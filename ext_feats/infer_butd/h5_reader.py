class ImageFeaturesHdfReader(object):
    """
    A reader for HDF files containing pre-extracted image features. A typical
    HDF file is expected to have a column named "image_id", and another column
    named "features".

    Example of an HDF file:
    ```
    visdial_train_faster_rcnn_bottomup_features.h5
       |--- "image_id" [shape: (num_images, )]
       |--- "features" [shape: (num_images, num_proposals, feature_size)]
       +--- .attrs ("split", "train")
    ```
    Refer ``$PROJECT_ROOT/data/extract_bottomup.py`` script for more details
    about HDF structure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    features_hdfpath : str
        Path to an HDF file containing VisDial v1.0 train, val or test split
        image features.
    in_memory : bool
        Whether to load the whole HDF file in memory. Beware, these files are
        sometimes tens of GBs in size. Set this to true if you have sufficient
        RAM - trade-off between speed and memory.
