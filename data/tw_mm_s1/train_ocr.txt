As we outlined earlier today over at this link, Syfy licenses the show from IDW, and the issues at the heart of production appear to be on that end. A report from Deadline today further corroborates that, stating that there are some financial issues that are keeping production from commencing. Syfy reportedly is willing to offer assistance to make it happen, knowing the value of this property and the devoted fans who tweet, discuss, and overall celebrate the show and these characters. The report also notes  that Wynonna Earp was quietly renewed already for a fifth season in addition to the publicly-known season 4 order. IDW is contractually obligated to deliver on those  seasons.

Not at all surprised that the Trudeau Liberals are looking to help out their Alberta NDP allies. We all know the Liberals would rather have an Alberta Govt that continues to act as doormat for Justin Trudeau, as opposed to a  UCP Govt that will actually stand up for Albertans.  Josh Wingrove @ @josh wingrove  Some Ottawa news for the #ableg crowd: A Liberal MP,  @MP JenOConnell, is asking the federal Speaker. and! the Board  of Internal Economy, to investigate @jkenney's expense claims, per a letter sent to the press gallery just now.     9:30 AM - 24 Jan 2019

RI  BA  EATH PENALTY.  RI  BA  UR POLI  ‘What has happened to our City over the past ten years? What has happened to law and order, to the neighborhood cop we all trusted to safeguard our homes and families, the cop who had the power under the law to help us in times of danger, keep us safe froma those who would prey on innocent lives to fulfill some distorted inner need. What has happened to the respect for authority, the fear of retribution by the courts, society and the police for those who break the law, who wantonly ‘on the rights of others? What has happened is the complete breakdown of life as we knew  Many New York families — White, Black, Hispanic and Asian — have had to give up the pleasure ofa leisurely stroll inthe Park at dusk, the Saturday visit to the playground with their families, the bike ride at dawn, or just sitting on their stoops — given them up as hostages to a world ruled by the law of the streets, as roving bands of wild criminals roam our neighborhoods. dispensing their own vicious brand of twisted hatrea ‘on whomever they encounter. At what point did we ‘ross the line from the fine and noble pursuit of genuine civil liberties to the reckless and dangerously permissive jere which allows criminals of every age to beat and rape a hel woman and then laugh at her family’s anguish? And why do they laugh? They laugh because they know that soon, very soon, they will be returned to the streets to rape and maim and kill once again — and yet face no great personal risk to themsel  Mayor Koch has stated that hate and rancor should be removed from our hearts, Ido not think so, I want to hate these muggers and murderers. ‘They should be forced to suffer and, when they kil     they should be executed for their crimes. They must serve as examples so that others will think long and. hard before committing a crime or an act of violence. Yes, Mayor Koch, I want to hate these murderers and I always will. am not looking to psychoanalyze or ‘understand them, 1am to; them. Ifthe punishment is strong, the attacks on innocent people will stop. I recently watched a newscast trying 10 explain the “anger in these young men”. Ino longer want to understand their anger. I want them to understand our anger. I want them to be afraid.  How can our great society tolerate the continued brutalization of its citizens by crazed ‘misfits? Criminals must be told that their CIVIL LIBERTIES END WHEN AN ATTACK ON ‘OUR SAFETY BEGINS!  ‘When I was young, I satin a diner with my father and witnessed two young bullies cursing and threatening a very frightened waitress. Two cops rushed in, lifted up the thugs and threw them out the door, warning them never to cause trouble again. 1 miss the feeling of secusity New York's finest once {gave to the citizens of this City.  Let our politicians give back our police department's power to keep us safe. Unshackle them from the constant chant of "police brutality” which every petty criminal hurls immediately at an officer who has just risked his or her life to save another's. We ‘must cease our continuous pandering to the criminal population of this City. Give New Yorx back to the Giulzens who have earned the right to be New Yorkers. Send a message loud and clear to those who woul ‘murder our citizens and terrorize New York—  BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY ‘AND BRING BACK OUR POLICE!        Donald J.

Dear President, I wanted to write how I really feel about you and your governing style as you are doing: so much, and yet many seem toimiss it. Many claim that  you are a-racist, petty, coward, mean, durb, a low-iife who should have never been elected.  Most people, if they just open their eyes, should be able the see the plain truth about you.  ‘en you say “the media is filled with fake news", you are 90 right,  as haters will hate and no one seens to ever give you a break. One day, I hope they stop saying you are the only thing that is fake. the media should just be holding @ mirror to you.  TE must be very frustrating to you, after all the hard sacrifices you have made.  T can't imagine doing your Job under these cixcuistances, every day worrying about  ingrates who are Rot realizing what a great negotiator and patriot you are. Instead they hope for sone scandal revealing you as an unpatriotic traitor or narcissistic £001.  It's hard to watch to be honest, day in and day out, T sonetines think T am going crazy.  ‘the job of the president, the leader of the free world is to lead by example,  and those who oppose you think their way {s better, and worse yet they say that  Af everyone followed yous Anerica will never be great again.  Soy T say this to anyone who would listen, as the next election is around the corer.  Your presidency is in danger     and we shall all unite to make sure me gather support, and learn from our mistake of letting opponents investigate you ~  there 19 no chance we Will make this mistake again. Me will campaign with (Nevoragain. Please be strong, gather your strengths, as the biggest battle of your Life is yet to cone, you are going places that most cannot even dream of. Places where there are many.  ‘of us cheering blindly to you. The naysayers will end up drunk and depressed in  bars. T can't wait to see that?  Oh yeah, one last thing, before I forget.  Your strategy to be nice to white nationalist, makes s0 much sense to me. after all, you can't be the president of everyone, if you aren't sympathetic to all. ‘the media? You don’t need then to survive, their protection. where you are going. Prigon is a dangerous place for nedia'winps ~ so lock them all up. ho needs then when we have you, your fanily, and other  shite billionaire:     P.S.4 if you wanted to know how I really feel about you Mr. President. read ay letter again, start with the first row and then read every other row. You see, the truth, like in your speeches, is between the Lines.

School quickly becomes a hos- tile environment in which these low achievers meet defeat daily in reading and writing. Early diagnosis and intervention are vital.  Gillingham wrote (1956):  The idea dawned upon me a good many years ago that if there  were some way by which we could select the language disability  children who were going to have trouble with reading later on, and teach them by the appropriate technique, we might save them from the heartache and frustration, and their parents from the anxiety and expense that is now met when the child is a reading case. I told the idea to Dr. Orton and he was quite interested in it. We discussed the type of material that might be helpful and when I later brought my data to him, we went over it together and se- lected the children who, in all reasonable human probability, were going to have difficulty in reading and spelling.

International Troika “deeply concerned” by Sudan government response to protests Radio Dabanga, January 9, 2019 | WASHINGTON / OSLO / LONDON / OTTAWA  The Troika (the UK, Norway and the USA) and Canada, have issued a joint statement including the warning that “the government of Sudan’s actions and decisions over the coming weeks will have an impact on the engagement of our governments and others in the coming months and years.” In the statement issued yesterday, the troika urges the governmdnt of Sudan “to respond to the current challenges by implementing the necessary political reforms, to allow the Sudanese people to exercise their constitutional rights to peacefully express their political, economic and social views freely and without any fear of retaliation or persecution.”  The Troika countries “continue to be deeply concerned about the government of Sudan’s response to the recent protests in Sudan, and the detention without charge or trial of a number of political activists and protesters. Our countries emphasise the right of the Sudanese people to protest peacefully and in accordance with the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, association, and expression guaranteed under Sudanese and international human rights law.  Legitimate right to protest  “We are appalled by reports of deaths and serious injury to those exercising their legitimate right to protest, as well as reports of the use of live ammunition against protesters. We urge the government of Sudan to ensure that a fully transparent and independent investigation into the deaths of protesters takes place as soon as possible, and that those responsible are held to account. [More preposterous posturing by Troika/Canada...demanding that the regime investigate “those responsible” when it is clear the regime is itself responsible. The evidence of regime orchestration of the violence against civilians—including medical personnel—is simply overwhelming. Asking the regime to investigate itself show how fare these Western countries have to come to be meaningfully involved in ending the brutality—ER]  “Furthermore, our countries call upon the government of Sudan immediately to release all journalists, political opposition leaders, human rights activists, and other protesters currently in detention without charge or trial, and to allow those facing charges full access to legal representation. [And when this doesn’t happen—or there is a temporary release from detention, but censorship remains stifling—what will the Troika/Canada say then? These are tepid, finally cowardly words from those who are uniquely positioned to bring immediate pressure on the regime. Begin by closing the regime’s embassies in these four countries—ER]  “The government of Sudan’s actions and decisions over the coming weeks will have an impact on the engagement of our governments and others in the coming months and years. We urge the government of Sudan to respond to the current challenges by implementing the necessary political reforms, to allow the Sudanese people to exercise their constitutional rights to peacefully express their political, economic and social views freely and without any fear of retaliation or persecution,” the new joint statement concludes.  [Given the history of the past 30 years, this is mere hortatory blather—ER]

January 23, 2019  The President  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Northwest Washington, D.C. 20500  Dear Mr. President: When I extended an invitation on January 3" for you to deliver the State of the Union address, it was on the mutually agreed upon date, January 29". At that time, there was no thought that the  government would still be shut down.  In my further correspondence of January 16", I said we should work together to find a mutually agreeable date when government has re-opened and I hope that we can still do that.  I am writing to inform you that the House of Representatives will not consider a concurrent resolution authorizing the President’s State of the Union address in the House Chamber until government has opened.  Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened.  Sincerely,  NANCY PELOSI  Speaker of the House

Life tobelived + 1 week ago  I'm really liking this new album. It is EXO at their best...  This song actually saved my goldfish's  life. About a week ago | walked into my daughter's room to feed our goldfish and | saw one of the pair swimming upside down at the bottom of the tank. That means it was near death with fish bloat. | hurried took it out and put it in a separate bowl  to try to get it moving. | just couldn't get  it to move fast enough by talking to it so | thought what about playing kpop. Nothing lost if it didn't work. So | put on this song. The fish started swimming. | just kept playing this as well as love shot. | played other kpop groups but the fish was partial to EXO. | had to do the same thing the next day because it still wasn't tip top. Now it's swimming around like a happy camper. So this is how EXO saved my fish...

Many only worship during #Ramadan. However, this Month could be the turning point for them, just like you once had yours. Do not mock them or put them down in any way. This is far from Prophet Muhammad's = character. He would always respect and praise people's spiritual upliftment, even if it was a little change they made, so as to motivate them to remain steadfast.

"Gathered together, we find our light and each spark shifts and multiplies, scattering it's radiance on our ordinary lives, like everything precious, more valuable when shared. Like every common miracle, made of the stuff of stars. Let the light shine, watch for it falling on each other's faces. Count the beams, catch them, let them be reflected back. See the hope, see the promise. Never hide your fears in silence, listen to those you cherish. Hold them in your arms, let them hear your heart. Tell your truth. Tell our story.  Tell your love.” O&

TeAustralia institute  Research hat mates,  That’s not how you haggle...  Commonwealth water purchasing in the Condamine Balonne  The Australian Government bought 29 gigalitres of water for $80m in the Condamine-Balonne valley. The vendors originally insisted on $2,200 per megalitre. But after negotiation, the Government paid a higher price - $2,745 per megalitre. Worse, the water has no legal status outside the farm gate and shouldn’t be counted towards the water recovery target.

He is a senior player, should show intent: Sachin criticises Dhoni  Ex-India cricketer Sachin Tendulkar criticised MS Dhoni for scoring 28 runs off 52 balls against Afghanistan in 2019 World Cup. “MS Dhoni is a senior player and should show positive intent. He faced too many dot balls and this hampered a strong finish for India," he added.

Earlier this afternoon Premier Ford accepted the resignation of his Chief of Staff, Dean French. Mr. French informed the Premier that he will be returning to the private sector after a successful first year of government, as he had always planned.  Mr. French served the Premier's Office during a successful transition to power and a first year that saw the setting in motion of more than 85% of the Premier's election commitments and the passing of 20 pieces of major legislation. Mr. French also played a key leadership role that helped create an environment for Ontario once again becoming open for business leading to the creation of more than 190,000 new jobs.  “| want personally thank Dean for his hard work, his leadership and his friendship. He is leaving our government in a very strong position from where we can build upon our successes and continue delivering on our priorities for the people of Ontario," stated Premier Ford. "Dean's legacy will be that of leading a historic and successful election campaign last year, as well as the incredible successes we have had in our government's first year. On behalf of the Government of Ontario, | wish Dean the very best in his future.”  Effective immediately, the Premier's Deputy Chief of Staff, Jamie Wallace, will assume the position of Interim-Chief of Staff, until a permanent replacement is announced.  -30-

State of New York County of Broome Government Offices        Office of the Broome County Executive Jason T. Garnar, County Executive  February 8, 2019  Jason T. Garnar  Broome County Executive 60 Hawley St. Binghamton, NY 13902  Dear Mr. Jeff Bezos,  As the Broome County Executive, it is my responsibility to better the quality of life of those residing in Broome County. As I continue to work to do so, I write to you today to express my support and endorsement of bringing the new Amazon headquarters to Broome County, New York.  Many of us in upstate NY can’t believe that New York City would actually say no to 25 thousand jobs, but Broome County will gladly take a company that will provide 25 thousand new jobs and five billion dollars of investment in a NY minute.  Broome County is uniquely situated in the middle of the Northeast within a few hours driving distance of New York City, Albany, Buffalo, Syracuse, Philadelphia, and Boston, among other large cities. Three major highways all intersect through Broome County, in addition to easy rail access and a regional airport with 300 acres of developable land.  Broome is also home to a world-class university, Binghamton University, one of the finest community Colleges in the United States, SUNY Broome Community College, and just an hour drive from Cornell University and Syracuse University.  For these reasons and many more, Broome County would be an ideal location for a project like HQ2 and we would welcome a new Amazon Corporate Headquarters into our community with open arms. I invite you to come tour our county at your convenience.  Sincerely,  Jason T. Garnar Broome County Executive  Broome County Office Building . 60 Hawley Street - P.O.

‘Salman Khan at the Expo       Being celebrity: Sallu’s visit sparks chaos at expo  Star enters Being Human stall for a few minutes, and frenzied fans send nearby stall crashing down  HEMALASHAR hema@id-day.com  THERE was nothing Chori Cho Chupke Chupke about Salman Khan’s visit to the Mumbai Mara- thon Expo at Bandra-Kurla Com- plex on Friday evening. Frenzied fans rushed to catch aglimpse of the Bollywood star who, accompanied by his brother Arbaaz, was paying a surprise visit to the Being Human stall at the expo. As people thronged the stall, the Asics stall came crash- ing down,  Utter chaos  Asubstantial number of people were at the expo at the MMRDA grounds, checking out stalls with fitness and wellness lifestyle products, and also collecting their bib numbers for the Mumbai marathon to be run on Sunday. Among the brands that had putup stalls were Being Human, Salman's charitable trust, and Asics, which makes top sports gear.  ‘Suresh Rathod, who is to run the 42-km marathon on Sunday, said, “I was at the Asics stall, doing a gait test on the treadmill I had just got off the treadmill and collected my racing bib, when I heard someone yell, ‘Salman Khan is here, Salman Khan is here. Within minutes, 1 hearda thud and saw the Asics store collapse."  He added, “There was chaos and people were trying to get pictures.                Shibani Gulati, expo visitor     The Asics stall cavesin  I saw a wall with an array of t-shirts had fallen. The passages in the expo are narrow, so it was crowded and I wanted to get out, as there could have been a crisis. Soon, I heard someone ask, where is Salman, and others said he had left. Security came inand were trying to clear the rubble” “Runners could have been injured. Why ask celebrities to visit these expos?” questioned Rathod. Runner Shibani Gulati, who was also at the expo, said, “People start- ed running around and, at first, we thought it was a fire. Then I learnt that Salman Khan was there. I left the place immediately.” she ended. Dilip Jayaram, chief executive officer of Procam International, or- ganisers of the Mumbai marathon, said, “Salman and Arbaaz decided to payan impromptu visit to the Being ‘Human stall. When the runners saw him, they thronged towards him for a picture. A wall caved in at the op- posite stall. The situation was soon brought under control” The Expo began on January 16 and ends today.             Inputs by Harit Joshi

|, Kitty Fallon > Team Pete Buttigieg 2020 ove / 5 minutes ago * e@ It's a done deal. Whatever the outcome of the 2020 Presidential Election, my life is forever changed by a brilliant, audacious and humble mayor from South Bend, Indiana. Pete Buttigieg is my Martin Luther King, Bobby Kennedy, John F. Kennedy, Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu, and Maya Angelou. He teaches me to see the heart's intent translated into policy and how centuries of racism play out in the grieving crowd pleading for justice and peace on the longest day of the year 2019 on the streets of South Bend. He reaches into my soul and my mind and invites me to join with him to design a campaign to earn the presidency and win an era. He connects with and fuels the eternal flame within my spirit, igniting my passion to join with others to finally dissolve the illusions of faulty assumptions and sand-built foundations that constructed a cracking nation over the essential brilliance of this grand democratic experiment.  We are at the moment in human history when it is necessary to assume the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God that all persons - without exception - and that all creation and the earth itself are endowed with unalienable Rights, and now is the time | am compelled to join with all those in the global family wanting to create a nation, a world, and an earth that honors and lifts up these rights for all. | cannot be anywhere or do anything else.  As with all the wise souls | listed, Pete Buttigieg is human, perfectly imperfect. He will not have all the answers, nor do | expect him to fix everything and get it right each time. He does not belong nor deserve to be placed on a pedestal and worshipped. Instead, he is a humble leader standing, pointing towards a higher and more perfect union among us all. It is to that place, that possibility that lives within each of us, where | feel inspired to go. He invites us all to go there and create that world together. | accept the invitation, the challenge, the possibility.


"and i'm still getting over my past... but i will tell you this, your friendship has made it a lot easier for me to move on and i'm grateful for what we have. so thank you for everything. thank you for all the long talks—for listening to me when i was breaking down. and thank you for bringing the sun with you—during the times 1 was drowning in rain."  —r.m. drake

@ ados101.com  ADOS     AMERICAN DESCENDANTS OF SLAVERY Black Agenda  As a specific group with a specific justice claim, the #ADOS movement demands a specific agenda with policy prescriptions that address the losses stemming from the institution of slavery, Jim Crow, rediining, convict leasing, mass incarceration and immigration.  We demand a New Deal for Black America which includes, but is not limited to:  * We need set asides for American descendants of slavery, not “minorities”, a throw-away category which includes all groups except white men. That categorization has allowed Democrats to use programs like affirmative actions as “giveaways” to all groups in exchange for votes. The bribery must end. That begins with a new designation on the Census with ADOS and another for Black immigrants. Black immigrants should be barred from accessing affirmative action and other set asides intended for ADOS, as should Asians, Latinos,  White WOM CQ aiiithlaitileicieeiiodiniiiie FOUPS. IN

March 22, 2019  The Honorable Lindsey Graham The Honorable Jerrold Nadler  Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary  United States Senate United States House of Representatives  290 Russell Senate Office Building 2132 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, D.C. 20510 Washington, D.C. 20515  The Honorable Dianne Feinstein The Honorable Doug Collins  Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary United States Senate United States House of Representatives  331 Hart Senate Office Building 1504 Longworth House Office Building Washington, D.C. 20510 Washington, D.C. 20515  Dear Chairman Graham, Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Ranking Member Collins:  I write to notify you pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 600.9(a)(3) that Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller Ill has concluded his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and related matters. In addition to this notification, the Special Counsel regulations require that I provide you with “a description and explanation of instances (if any) in which the Attorney General” or acting Attormey General “concluded that a proposed action by a Special Counsel was so inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices that it should not be pursued.” 28 C.F.R. § 600.9(a)(3). There were no such instances during the Special Counsel’s investigation.  The Special Counsel has submitted to me today a “confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions” he has reached, as required by 28 C.F.R. § 600.8(c). I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel’s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend.  Separately, I intend to consult with Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein and Special Counsel Mueller to determine what other information from the report can be released to Congress and the public consistent with the law, including the Special Counsel regulations, and the Department’s long-standing practices and policies. I remain committed to as much transparency as: possible, and I will keep you informed as to the status of my review.  ‘ Finally, the Special Counsel regulations provide that “the Attorney General may determine that public release of” this notification “would be in the public interest.” 28 C.F.R. § 600.9(c). Ihave so determined, and I will disclose this letter to the public after delivering it to you. ;  Sincerely,  filiam B: G  Attorney General

"| don't know if there's a better story in college football about perseverance and bouncing back. He's easily one of the best talents in this draft and I'm thrilled that he was able to be picked. He's going to be able to prove to the Bengals that they made a great decision. He's a tremendous player and an incredibly dedicated player, and you just really have to appreciate the journey he's been on. I'm so happy for him."

DES  aS Tay        ROCKET MORTGAGE CLASSIC

OFFICIAL STATEMENT  From Virgin Group we want to establish a position in relation to the funds raised in the Venezuela Aid Live concert, held on February 22, 2019 in the city of Cucuta, Colombia.  In the last few hours, officials of the administration of the government of Venezuelan President Juan Guaidé have been involved in corruption schemes for which we are not responsible or have any connection.  Since the idea of a mass call to demand freedom and democracy in Venezuela arose, our commitment was for everyone to come together for this cause and contribute a grain of sand to help people that is going through the worst crisis of their history, but what is collected there and the use that those resources were given is not our competence, we were only a platform, so we repudiate anyone who has tried to enrich themselves in the name of hunger and disease of people needed.  Venezuela needs answers for what we put at the disposal of all the international authorities to collaborate in what they need to get to the bottom of this painful episode.  ia vf  Your great friend, Richard Branson \ A L | y \

FAQ  Why 100% clean and renewable and not just 100% renewable? Are you saying we won’t transition off fossil fuels?  Yes, we are calling for a full transition off fossil fuels and zero greenhouse gases. Anyone who has read the resolution sees that we spell this out through a plan that calls for eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from every sector of the economy. Simply banning fossil fuels immediately won’t build the new economy to replace it - this is the plan to build that new economy and spells out how to do it technically. We do this through a huge mobilization to create the renewable energy economy as fast as possible. We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and  “power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero.

@ skamfrance.tumbir.com  Brut Interview - Maxence Danet Fauvel & Coline Preher  Coline: Everyday | got Instagram messages of people who say “I came out thanks to  you’. Maxence: We try to show the truth actually, of what its like to realize you're gay at 16.  “Actors in Skam France, Maxence Danet Fauvel & Coline Preher tell us how the success of this show changed their lives and sometimes those of their fans.”     Mz It's true that it includes a certain amount of responsibility because in a way, these people, when we see them in real life, when they stop us in the street or when we see them like this during conventions, they tell us their stories, and it's really hard because you can't haif listen to them, And that's why this phenomenon..we're getting a little ‘overwhelmed because you want to spend an hour with each person, because they have really moving stories to tell.  ¢: There's one message in particular that touched me deeply. It's a girl who wrote to me from Turkey and who told me that her best friend had come out thanks to Alexia, Eliott and Lucas. And | didn't see the message at the time. | replied to her one week later, saying “Im proud of her. Im happy" and ail that, and she said “Ah, I don't know how to tell you this, she came out and she committed suicide because her parents reacted badly’, And it touched me deeply. And it's hard to handle that.  Girl: Maxence, a hug, please!  M: We're in a career that's related to image. We're doing a job that has an impact on people. We're cloing a job which allows us to have visibility, and | think it's awesome to use that to help causes.  C: When it comes to love, there are no sexualities, no barriers, no borders. And in a character like Alexia, bisexuality isn't this thing where you're lost, you don't know if you're straight, if you're gay. Bisexuality exists. Loving both exists, and that's the kind of message we're carrying,     M: it's awesome to be able to reach this new generation, these people who are ‘coming in and who will change the society of tomorrow. If we can, on our scale, make mentalities evolve..And it's a scale with a considerable impact, compared to the one we were expecting,  CiExactly.  M: We expected a normal impact, and when we see the proportions it takes, it moves us.  zits going up steadily, and that's so important for us too. “Here's the message they'd like to convey to the teens who watch them”  €: All these questions you have in your head about who you are, why youre here, ‘everyone has them. And do what you want to do. Like, live. Live.  M: And it's not necessarily gonna be easy. It's not necessarily gonna be easy, but as we're trying to show, sometimes accepting who you are..No, always, aecepting who you are solves everything.

El;Salvador,


think about these guys, the '85 team, the '16 team, the '13 team, there are just so many moments that you think back on when you're just not having that good day. That's what you play for. If | talked to Burke Masters right now, what would he say? He would love to be out there today. He would love to be out there ina 20-degree game in the snow. He would love to go back out there and wear this [uniform] one more time. So, that's what you think about. You think about the tradition here, the guys that would give anything to come back for one more day, and that's what | think about. This is my last year and the guys that might not play at the next level think about that, this is all we have for right now. You think back about what we've had here and all of the guys that would give anything to go out there and play one more game, relive one more moment. That's what you have to think about.

Having anxiety and depression is like being scared and tired at the same time. It's the fear of failure but no urge to be productive. It's wanting friends but hate socialising. It's wanting to be alone but not wanting to be lonely. It's caring about everything then caring about nothing. It's feeling everything at once then feeling paralysingly numb.

[KIM EUN-JIN}  Only five years since its launch, ul:kin has become one of the most highly-anticipated brands each fashion week, recognized by its characteristic multi-layered pairing of different types of clothing - take jean jackets and sweaters, for example - pieced together with artful taste and structural balance  Last Friday, taking one of the prime time slots of the 2019 F/W Seoul Fashion Week, utkin filled the 700-seat runway space with fashion insiders and celebrities while debuting its new collection, titled "No Norma,” exploring the idea that the standards people define as, “normal” or “average” are based on a faulty logic that doesn really describe or fit anyone. A unique mash-up of blazer sleeves, silky dresses and padded vests were featured during the show.  ‘There's more to ul:kin than just scene-stealing hybrid outfits, however. In Korea, the brand -  worn by celebrities like BTS’ Jungkook, HyunA and boy band Winner - is almost ‘synonymous with upeycled fashion.     “Around 50 percent of the pieces in our collection have been upcycled and created from existing clothing made by our own brand and others” CEO Lee Seong-dong told the Korea JoongAng Daily at his booth during the trade show held at the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (ODP), central Seoul, on Saturday.  Upcycled fashion, especially bags, has been a defining part of ulkin's identity since its inception in 2014. On its website, the brand has a whole section dedicated to bags ‘transformed directly from the canvases of rising artists that would otherwise have been ‘thrown away,  Bags in the premium line are one-of-a-kind. The brand also manufactures bags featuring artwork prints to cater to a wider audience  “1 aot the idea [to upcycle baas] after visiting a friend's graduation exhibition” Lee said. “!

——EE————EE  Slow Swirl at the Edge of the Sea  Listen, love—the cliffs are tired  of restraining us, tired of the questions  we ask each other about time. But  we've forgotten our schedules tonight  and find luxury in the silk pillow-  case, camisole, the petal wings of moths fluttering at the window. We lie  together in a bed of beach music  above a small village of fishermen,  of ferries and pathways.  When they lower the boats, the sea swallows hard and we slip beneath a blue brushstroke, not knowing who will stay under  and who will make it back to shore.

Gasfield Free Northern Rivers, April 2019  F is for FAIL —a list of Coalition failures on climate policy  Since 2013 the Coalition has:  1. Eliminated the Climate Commission  2. — Severely reduced funding for CSIRO climate change research  3. Appointed a ‘climate skeptic’ to review the national Renewable Energy Target  4. Slashed the national Renewable Energy Target  5. Attacked wind farms, backed a hostile senate inquiry into safe windfarm technology  6. — Presided over the loss of 1 in 3 jobs in Australia’s renewable energy sector  7. Suggested “coal is good for humanity”  8. Brandished a lump of coal in parliament while Australians on the east coast suffered a record- breaking heatwave  9. Attempted to abolish the national Clean Energy Finance Corporation - twice  10. Suggested that so-called “clean coal” and gas power should receive funding from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation  11. Cut the budget of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) by $500 million  12. Ruled out an Emissions Intensity Scheme before considering the merits of the policy  13. Repealed the carbon price penalty for corporations that pollute our air and cause climate change  14. Supported Adani’s Carmichael coal mine and coal export industry  15. Continued calls to overturn bans and moratoria on unconventional gasfields  16. Greenhouse gas emissions have risen for 4 years running. Australia is unlikely to meet its Paris targets according to the government's own department  17. Senior ministers continue to falsely claim that emissions are going down.  18. The federal government has consistently delayed releasing information on Australia’s greenhouse emissions, often publishing data at Christmas, to avoid scrutiny.  19. The Federal Government censored a UN report about climate change and World Heritage sites, to remove any reference to Australian sites.  20. The government has used discredited accounting methods for emissions, to make its record look better than reality.  21. The Coalition could not even stand taking weak action on climate. They dropped their own NEG policy, and sacked Malcolm Turnbull.  22. Australians are on the frontline of worsening extreme weather. Heatwaves are hotter and last longer. Droughts, intense rainfall and dangerous bushfire conditions have become more severe. The Coalition has failed Australians and puts them in harms way.  23. And yet, when the urgency has never been greater, the government now wants to underwrite new coal power stations. This is worse than ‘failure’. It’s reckless endangerment.  Sources:  Climate Cuts, Cover-ups and Censorship. A detailed overview of the Australian governments approach to climate change since the election of the Liberal-National Coalition government in 2013.

So | threw my truck in park and | hopped out. | didn’t know it was Biggio. When | hopped out, | couldn’t see who was driving because of the airbags and the smoke, it was just very chaotic. When we pulled the guy out of the truck and | realized it was Biggio, my heart just dropped.  It was a lesson. You’ve got to cherish the moments you have with the guys around you. In the Blue Jays organization, we’re like a family. Just like that, your life can change. That was a moment for me to just reflect on how fast things can change for you, whether it’s me or anybody else. It gave me a different perspective.

“?'m working on a DCU movie now (New Gods with Ava DuVernay) and a secret TV show thing that hasn’t been announced,’ King tells EW. “DC was kind enough to see that doing all that and a twice-monthly Batman would be tough. So they divided the Batman book into two monthly books, Batman and Batman/Catwoman. Bat/Cat will complete this epic story we've been telling and lead to this game-changing moment I’ve been hinting at. Batman will...well, I can’t tell you, but it’s very cool. But, because of the beats that will be handled in Batman, I have more room for my storylines in Bat/Cat, which means that the twelve issues can cover all of the story  that was part of the original plan”  King continues, “I used to think Batman #100 was the biggest book I’d ever write. Now it’s Bat/Cat #12. Same issue, same artist, same  impact, different name—slightly different.”

Somewhere within this sequence — perhaps after Shakespearean England but before Revolutionary France — was supposed to be one more time capsule: Aziraphale opening his bookshop for the first time. Gabriel shows up to tell Aziraphale that he’s been promoted and can go back to Heaven, but Aziraphale doesn’t want to go. Crowley turns up with chocolate and flowers to congratulate Aziraphale, and overhears the conversation, so he instead turns around and sets up something where Aziraphale needs to intervene, to prove to Gabriel that Aziraphale’s appearance on earth is vital. “It was really funny,” Gaiman said. But his justification for taking it out was that it didn’t push the story forward as much as the other moments did.

Iam sick roy ed Ce) evidence against the democrats and no handcuffs!

Now ALP  skipping the Bill on flyers  EXCLUSIVE SHERADYN HOLDERHEAD  BILL Shorten has gone miss- ing from Labor campaign ma- terials in must-win seats as polling reveals voters in mar- ginal electorates dislike the Opposition Leader.  Internal Coalition polling has Mr Shorten at minus 19 overall on its favourability measure in about 20 marginal seats across the country, which means the voters who dislike the Labor leader outnumber those who like him,  The Daily Telegraph has obtained Labor mailouts for seven NSW electorates that fail to mention Bill Shorten — including battleground seats of Gilmore, Lindsay, Robertson and Bennelong — in further evidence that Mr Shorten is weighing on the party's bid to govern.  Even deputy Labor leader Tanya  Plibersek’s.| March newsletter did not make men- tion of Mr Shorten.  A Coalition campaign source said it comes up consist- ently in internal research that people find Mr Shorten “un- trustworthy and they think he is hiding something’.  The Coalition clearly be- lieve Scott Morrison is winning the battle for popularity given the Prime Minister has taken to repeating the line: “If you vote for Bill Shorten you'll get            Bill Shorten. If you vote for me and the Liberal and National parties you will get me to serve youas your prime minister.  Mr Shorten's image issues have clearly been at the front of mind for the Labor cam- paign, with Ms Plibersek play- ing a front and centre role and campaign posters focusing on selling the pair as a leadership package deal,  But it’s not all good news for the Coalition, with Labor's in- ternal track-polling recording swinging voters in marginal seats in the past week labelling Mr Morrison as “hopeless”, “Jurching to the right”, a “back- stabber” and “immature”,  Labor also pointed out that some Liberals — including Wentworth candidate Dave Sharma — have stripped their materials of party branding  Mr Sharma, who lost his bid to win former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull's vacated seat in October's by-election to Kerryn Phelps, was instead using the slogan “a modern Liberal” on his corflutes.  The most recent Newspoll put Mr Shorten’s satisfaction rating at minus 14, with 37 per cent of respondents satisfied with the Opposition Leader compared with 51 per cent who were dissatisfied.  On the same measure Mr Morrison was at plus 1, with 45 per cent satisfied and 44 per cent dissatisfied

I De a SU ETO | MUELLER EDITION 1. Collusion isn’t the whole story. There are 50 shades of corruption.  . Monitor your bias, Stories about “links to Russia” are hard to source but easy to buy.  . Has the reporter seen the evidence? That’s key, especially when the story relies on unnamed sources,  4, Terms like “process crime” and “perjury trap” are used to discount serious indictments,  . Wait for a bombshell to be corroborated, not just quoted, by multiple outlets,  . Ignore rumors of the Mueller report's imminent release and its contents, The public might never see Mueller’s complete findings.  . The press may confuse Mueller’s whole report with the summary he must deliver to Congress (and on to us).  . The Mueller probe is no deus ex machina, It’s not his job to uncover it all. Nearterm judgment on Trump's action will be political, not legal or moral. . Give yourself a break from the coverage; a fuller picture will emerge.  a) THE Ey] ONTHEWEDILORS = RVIMBINC.  wm  oOo ™~ m@ cn  =s

Senator BLUMENTHAL. Turning to another area, if I may, the ust ‘of contractors. Following up on the very important questions asked © by my colleague Senator McCain, just to state the obvious, her was a contractor who was entrusted with responsibilities that” never should have been, and I think many of us are concerned by the scope and scale of the use of private contractors even to screen ' and evaluate other contractors. Are you concerned? g Admiral RoGErs. Yes, sir, I share your concern. If confirmed, this - is an area that I think I need to ask some hard questions. Why are’ we where we are today? What led us to this, and are we com-_ fortable with the position we find ourselves in with respect to the role of contractors?

In our service yesterday we spoke to our congregation about increases to our overall church operating costs. We stated that in recent years there has been an increase to our overall operating costs of about $50,000 per year.  The Carbon tax was used as one example of the kind of increases we have incurred.  Someone misunderstood that to mean the Carbon tax was responsible for the entire $50,0000 increase and tweeted about it.  For us the Carbon tax is not a political issue. We are more than happy to pay our bills, whatever they are and need to be. Many people in our congregation are concerned about environmental issues.  For us the conversation is more about how we as a church need to adapt our budget to reflect the current costs.  The Carbon Tax portion of these increased costs is $5443.00 which is about 10% of the entire overall increase.

Nicholas Lewin ’04  HOME | STUDYINGLAW AT VALE | ALUMNI& STUDENT PROFILES | NICHOLAS LEWIN og  Assistant U.S. Attorney, Southern District of New York  I've served as an Assistant US. Attorney in the Southern District of New York since 2007, working principally on terrorism and other national security cases (such as espionage. counter-proliferation, and counterintelligence). | graduated from YLS in 2004, and then clerked for two wonderful years — first on the Southern District of New York. then on the Second Circuit. | came straight to the US. Attorney's Office from my second clerkship. Between clerkships, | worked for about a year at a twenty-odd- lawyer litigation firm in Manhattan called Lankler, Siffert and Woht  A brief aside: | had a terrific experience at Lankler, Siffert and Wohl. This firm, like a handful of other small litigation firms in New York, is comprised largely of former prosecutors. The firms are structured and orlented in a fundamentally different way than the larger firms, but are often involved in the same cases as those firms. As a result, the work, the people (and even the quality of life) were truly excellent. But this     is no non-sequitur: working at a small firm like this one—where many of the partners had been AUSAs—significantly advanced my application to the USS, Attorney's Office.

Develop a plan on how best to teach these skills and techniques.  Treat each player as a unique person.  Demonstrate sincere interest in each player.  Gain the players’ confidence by working with each athlete to help him reach his full potential by enhancing his level of abilities.  Determine how each player best responds to instruction (i.e., comprehends new information, maintains his attention span, learns new materials, etc.).  Be sensitive to and flexible with the players’ moods and demeanors while teaching and coaching.

Two Old English Sheep- dogs were in tartan and Union Jack coats — while a Dalmatian owner wore a white one with black spots to match her pet’s fur.  Samoyed pooch Kazhiya lovingly licked owner Lisa Mair Jones’s face on the second of the four days.  And Bull Mastiff Jim did  ittle and large act with his Chihuahua pal Tanzi.

Star Trek  FIRST DRAPT  Created by: GENE RODDENBERRY March 11, 1964     STAR TREK is...  A one-hour dramatic television series.  Action - Adventure - Science Fiction.  The first such concept with strong central lead characters plus other  continuing regulars,  And while maintaining a familiar central location and regular cast, explores an anthology-like range of exciting human experience. For example, as varied as ...  THE NEXT CAGE. The Gesperation of our series lead, caged and on exhibition like an animal, then offered a mate.  THE DAY CHARLIZ BECAME GOD. The accidental occurrence of infinite power to do all things, in the hands of a very finite man.  PRESIDENT CAPONE, A parallel world, Chicago ten years after Al Capone won and imposed gangland statutes upon the nation.  0 SKIN A TYRANNOSAURUS. A modern man reduced to a sling and 4 club in @ world 1,000,000 B.C.  THE WOMEN. Duplicating a page from the "Old West"; hanky-panky aboard with a cargo of women destined for a far-off colony.  TE COMING. Alien people in an alten society, but something disturbingly familiar about the quiet dienity of one who is being condenned to crucifixion.  {See later pages for more)

BLUES SEND POLAK TO TORONTO  Swap upstages Day 2 of draft as club obtains lefthanded-shooting defenseman Gunnarsson.  BY JEREMY RUTHERFORD jruthertordeapost-dispatch.com 318-049-7135  ‘The Blues closed the Roman Polak door on Saturday, but opened others forkevin Shattenkirk and Tan Cole.  Polak, a sixth-round pick of the Blues in 2004 who climbed up through the minor-league system to become an NHL regular, was traded to Toronto for defenseman Carl Gun narsson and a fourth-round draft pick.  “The move ends Polak's eight-year run in St, Louis, where he gained much acclaim in the 2012 playofts following a lopsided win in a fight with San Jose’ Justin Braun. After~ wards, Blues coach Ken Hitchcock told reporters: “Don’t open the Ro- man Polak door Don’t ever open that door”  ‘On Day 2 of the NHL draft, how- ever, the Blues closed that door with 4 deal that will provide Shattenkirk with a quality lefthanded-shooting defensive partner and give Cole an opportunity to play in the club's ota tion of its top six at the position, al- belt onhis of side.  “We really believe the strength of our organization is our defense,’ Blues general manager Doug Arm- strong said. “When you have players like (Jay) Bouwmeester, (Alex) Pi- etrangelo and Shattenkirk, you want to build around that and T think get ting alefthanded player at Gunnars- son's age (27), with his track record of playing with atop player in Dion Phaneuf, and against top players in the league, this was something we needed tolookat.  “As Tsay, to get a lefthanded de- fenseman, we have to give up aright hhanded defenseman and a quality person. We paid a strong price to get What we hopes a strong player. (But) it wasa deal that we were very com- fortable making.  **We could have used (Barret) jack- man or fan) Coe in that position, as we've done in the past. But you'r al~ ‘ways looking to tweak your roster and wwe were able todo that.”  So the Bhies intent for next season is to pair Bouwmeester with Pietran- gelo, Gunnarsson with Shattenkirk and Cole onthe right side with either Jackman or Jordan Leopold.  “Tana been wanting this respon- sibility for amumber of years, and now he has the door wide open for that spot on the right side" Armstrong said, "I leave that up to the coaches, Bat inthe thought process of making that trade, we want to get Tan into our group and he provides the size and [power that we're losing in Roman. ‘Then, wete going to have great com~ petition betveeen Jackman and Leop- old, rounding out our group.”  Armstrong added that Gunnars~ son's ability to play in the top pair allows the Blues to split up Bouw- meester and Pietrangelo ifthe team desires.  Gunnarsson averaged 19 minutes, 24 seconds of ie time per game with the Maple Leafs in 2013-14, play- ing primarily with Phaneuf. He had three goals and 17 points, but more     impressively was his plus-12 rating on a team that ranked No. 26 in the ‘NHL in goals-against average (3.07 er game),  “He's a quick first-pass player, reads the game well, defends with his head’ Armstrong said. “We believe the strength of our team is to get the puck up and attack. We want to give the centerman the puck at the right spot and Gunnarsson does that?”  Gunnarsson had a hip issue that re= uired surgery this offseason, but the Blues are not concemed.  “We got his medical information?’ ‘Armstrong said. “He got the surgery done in Nashville and our medical doctors not only talked to the train= ing staff, but also the doctor that did the surgery. We were very comfort able that he'll be ready at the start of the season.”  Polak, 28, heads to Toronto after Posting 13 goals, 79 points and a mi~ nhus-7 rating in 424 games with the Blues. The Maple Leafs, an organiza- tion now run by former Blue Brendan Shanahan, were looking for a player ‘who could provide a physical pres- ‘enceand mobility on the right side.  “You have to be able to skate and move?" Shanahan said. “That's why other teams were looking for him as well”  ‘The Blues were willing to part with Polak despite those attributes and his longstanding status with the fran- chise  “We lose a player that ... he’s a St. Louis Blue in the sense drafted there, developed there, came through the system,” Armstrong said. “You lose someone that’s an excellent feam- rate, well-liked in the room and ob- viously he's a strong competitor . just abig, physical body”  ‘The salaries ofthe two defensemen are nearly awash.  Gunnarsson has two years remain- ing on his deal with a Salary-cap hit of $3.15 million. Polak has two more seasons left onhis contract with acap hit of $2.75 million. The Maple Leafs “will retain $200,000 of Gumnarsson’s salary to make the exchange even more of asplit.  ‘The third component of the trade was a fourth-round pick (No. 94 overall) sent to the Blues.

If the Special Counsel has reason to believe that the President has engaged in criminal or other serious misconduct, then the President must be subject to accountability either in a court or to the Congress. But because the Department has taken the position that a sitting President is immune from indictment and prosecution,’ Congress could be the only institution currently situated to act on evidence of the President’s misconduct. To maintain that a sitting president cannot be indicted, and then to withhold evidence of wrongdoing from Congress because the President will not be charged, is to convert Department policy into the means for a cover-up. The President is not above the law.         Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, .

Parliament has contradicted itself tonight. MPs were right to vote to reject a no-deal Brexit. But they also voted to send Theresa May back to Brussels to renegotiate the withdrawal deal, which the EU has already said they will not do - this is delaying the inevitable. In reality this makes the possibility of a no-deal Brexit more likely.  This shows, once again, that its time to take this out of politicians' hands, and give the public the final say on Brexit - with the option to stay in the EU.

McAdams votes for permanent protection for young immigrants brought to the U.S. as children  Supports the Dream and Promise Act of 2019  Washington DC—Congressman Ben McAdams today voted to permanently protect a group of Utah immigrants from deportation who are eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program—also known as Dreamers. McAdams voted for the “American Dream and Promise Act of 2019" (H.R. 6) which would assist more than 20,000 Dreamers who call Utah home. The bill passed the House with bipartisan support.  “The individuals known as Dreamers are our classmates, our coworkers, our neighbors and members of our congregations. Brought here as young children, this is the only home most of them have ever known. They are working, serving in the military, enrolled in college, and are giving back to the community. For too long, they have been in limbo about their future and this legislation offers a solution,” said McAdams.  Dreamers in Utah who are eligible under the bill arrived in the U.S. at the average age of 8 years old. In Utah's 4" Congressional District, 7,200 individuals are part of the DACA program. The bill is supported by over 200 national and local groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Human Rights Watch, the Leaque of Women Voters, the NAACP, the National Council of Churches, and YWCA USA.  McAdams said that over the past two years actions by the administration have threatened to end the DACA program, creating tremendous uncertainty for DACA recipients, their families, and their employers. McAdams said that DACA recipients in Utah own 2,500 homes and pay $28 milion in annual mortgage payments, as well as contribute $138.7 million in federal taxes.  McAdams said the Dreamers would initially receive conditional work authorization cards and could earn lawful permanent resident status by acquiring a college degree or technical education certification; completing two years of military service; or being ‘employed for periods of time totaling at least three years and at least 75 percent of that time that the person has had employment authorization. Eventually, they could apply for citizenship.  “This is an important step towards fixing our broken immigration system that keeps families together and helps our economy. It moves us forward on a path to comprehensive immigration reform that ultimately strengthens our borders and bolsters legal immigration,” said McAdams, “It is the job of Congress to take action on these reforms, which are woefully overdue and that have overwhelming support throughout Utah.”  Two other groups of immigrants covered by the legislation include those eligible for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) or Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) status. Immigrants eligible for TPS or DED programs are from counties of origin experiencing ‘ongoing armed conflict, natural disasters or other extraordinary conditions and have, on average, lived in the U.S. since 1997.

Some members of the Blue Squad — not in uniform and not performing — sat in their usual seats inside the Corbett Sports Center, according to multiple media reports. The cheerleaders didn’t perform at the Aggies’ home games Saturday or Monday. They haven’t  practiced since last week.  An athletics department spokesman said Tuesday that this period of reduced activity will last until at least Feb. 19. x  rgy is becoming = eve 3 | =  Peering

DID DEMOCRATS STEAL BORDER  SECURITY BARRIER FUNDS?     In 2006, 50 Billion Dollars was set aside for the Secure Fence Act. It was to be a double wall fence that covered 700 miles. President George W. Bush signed the Bill and Obama was to oversee the project.  On May 16, 2011, Obama announced that the fence was virtually completed. But, he lied.  In fact, there was only 36.3 miles of the 700 mile fence completed at the time he made that announcement. The fence was actually just a barrier to keep vehicles from driving through. Not a security barrier or even a chain- link fence to keep people out.  Where is the remainder of the 50 Billion Dollars set aside for the Secure Fence Act ?  Where did that money go? Did Obama fund ISIS with that money? Did Obama give that money to Iran? Did the Democratic Party keep that money? Did the Democrats steal Billions of Dollars from the American people, all funds allocated for our security?

“A lot of people are going to be surprised, and you don’t need a law degree to understand this verdict. It is an absolute and complete victory for Michael Jackson, utter humiliation and defeat for Thomas Sneddon, the district attorney who has been pursuing Michael Jackson for more than a decade, who brought a case that was not one that this jury bought at all. This one’s over.”  — CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin

BrexitUtopia, St Albans, United Kingdom, 16 hours ago  When Experts like London School of Economics, CBI, Bank Of England, nine out of ten top City experts were saying in 2016 that leaving the EU Single market and CU will result in a huge exodus of Car manufactures, huge job losses in Aviation industry, Financial Services, agriculture etc Gove, Farage and Boris Johnson said do not listen to experts, people had enough of experts. Thatgs what happens when you donét listen to experts and listen to Brexit charlatans instead. Nissan workers had a letters from Nissan management not to vote Leave cos they might lose their jobs and still voted Leave, sorry but thats just stupid.  Reply 4> 254 <> 126

@ Erik Davis @ L #SpiderManFarFromHome & is funny, exciting, romantic, goofy & follows HOMECOMING in being this brilliant ground-level look at Spidey's world & how the events of  #AvengersEndgame@® impacted everyday life. Lots of twists & turns, plus some adorable summer romances, too. I'm a big fan  ® Jim Vejvoda @  Spider-Man: Far from Home is an extremely fun, cleverly executed, and frequently hilarious culmination of the MCU's wall-crawler’s journey so far. Some very sweet moments, sly commentary and deft action set-pieces throughout #SpiderManFarFromHome  9 Mike Ryan @ L  Absolutely loved SPIDER-MAN: FAR FROM HOME. I'm a huge Mysterio fan and Gyllenhaal nails him. Also the movie is very clever (and funny) how it handles the fallout post ENDGAME in explaining how this world works now.  & Eric Goldman © . #SpiderManFarFromHome @ isn't quite as wonderful as Homecoming, but it’s a really strong, endearing sequel that delivers some excellent moments in its second half in particular. It commendably furthers Peter's story while laying groundwork for what's next in a notably deft way.  @ Eric Walkuski @  #SpiderManFarFromHome is avery worthy follow-up to the phenomenal #Homecoming. Tom Holland proves (once again) that he's the definitive Peter Parker, and his chemistry with @Zendaya is legitimately sweet and engaging.                                                                                                                absolute home run. It’s SO much fun. It's huge in itself and for the future of the MCU in the most surprising ways. Tom Holland, Jake Gyllenhaal, just a lethal, awesome combo!!  | cannot wait to see this movie again. And again.  €& Steven Weintraub @ :  absolutely loved #SpiderManFarFromHome @. Captures the spirit of the comics and mixes in some amazing movie magic. The second the film ended | wanted to watch it again. #JakeGyllenhaal is fantastic as Mysterio.  ss Germain Lussier @ L Spider-Man: Far From Home made me smile from start to finish. Its got huge reveals and exciting set pieces but the way it builds off Endgame to to dive deeper into Peter's emotions is really what make it soar. Mysterio also rules. | can’t wait to see it again.  @ Maude Garrett @ ss  #Spiderman #FarFromHome is SUCH a good movie! Jake Gyllenhaal suits up & completely embraces his role in its entirety & he's clearly having a blast. This is such a refreshing film after the heaviness of #EndGame@. The post-credit scenes are a MUST WATCH & will blow your dang mind!                     a Brian Truitt @ U Didn't LOVE #SpiderManFarFromHome & as much as Homecoming but it's still a rad take on bearing the weight of great expectations and a fun ode to teen romance. Tom Holland continues to be amazing, Zendaya’s MJ is just as cool as Shuri and Jake G's an inspired choice for Mysterio.

Ohyeah. | got in yesterday for a workout on our day off and saw big box in the equipment room. Just happened to catch it out of the corner of my eye and wondered if it was mine.

What | love about Killing Eve now more than ever  They're not pandering to their LGBT+ audience. This isn'ta wink wink nudge nudge throw scraps to the gays to keep them coming.  This is unabashedly homoerotic. The core of this show is a demented, unhealthy obsession between two women. There's no other agenda. They're not playing us.  After years of being queerbaited and being catered to in sub plots and killed off characters, Killing Eve is here saying, “fuck that.”  Killing Eve is a critically acclaimed show that is 100% about two unhealthy women who wantto kiss/fuck/kill/save eachother.  And that is fucking awesome.  Source: sapphicsynthtechnology

29 March 2018 Media Release  In the role of: Minister for Revenue and Financial Services [19 July 2016 - 28 August 2018]  Serious financial crime taskforce smashes Australia’s biggest ever tax fraud  Joint media release with The Hon. Angus Taylor MP Minister for Law Enforcement and Cyber Security  Australia's biggest tax fraud was brought to an end today following the hard work of the Turnbull Government's Serious Financial Crime Taskforce (SFCT).  The Supreme Court of NSW sentenced Michael Issakidis to 10 years and 3 months jail, with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months, for his involvement in the largest ever successfully prosecuted tax fraud case in Australia’s history. He and co-conspirator Anthony Dickson deliberately absorbed $450 million of otherwise assessable income through falsely created losses in eins to evade $135 million in tax through the use of tax and complex international trust structures.     Today's result follows the landmark sentencing of co-accused Dickson who in 2015 was sentenced to 11 years' jail, which was later increased to 14 years on appeal. Dickson's se 6 marked the longest jail sentence ever handed down f  fraud and money-laundering.

Read this g www.cybercivitrights.org/faqs/  Quit your fucking whining because the people you sent your nudes to have already been advised that it is not illegal to post or publish them because you know what, twat? You SENT them to their mobile devices, and KNOWINGLY shared them, unlike my images here. So eat shit! See? You are a dumbass cunt.  Stop your whining before you really piss off people who has your ugly, disgusting, droopy, banana-like teats and they DECIDE to publish them. AND even if they crop your face, the same cheap ass necklace you own is still showing and people can tell. So, ZIP the twangy piehole, okay? Let it blow over mother fucker! And if you are worried 1 will post them here, don't worry twat, because my website is free from hideous and fugly like you. 1 would never stain the beauty of this blog site with your skank. Now, fuck off, mind your business and no one else has to be traumatized with your disgusting nudes. That's how you and your other skank friends got your following, huh? You two have been sending your teats to everyone. Drips at least sent them to a Lunatic president. @ You guys can't keep them covered up. JFC, some of the guys even say they don't ask, you guys would be just having a conversation and BOOM! Teats in their DMs. @ @ @ @ 50... stop acting like queen assholes and uneducated VIPs on Twitter because many guys say your teats are both gross. You two will get shunned just like Jahya's ho bags. Carly/Birch had her gross teats exposed by magats and yours will be coming out soon. Leave those of us resisters alone! Fucking 40 plus year old hags teat flashing. Don't make me post them here.

CUBS NAME MARK LORETTA BENCH COACH,  BOB TEWKSBURY COORDINATOR, MENTAL SKILLS WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 2, 2019  CHICAGO - The Chicago Cubs today named Mark Loretta as bench coach to replace Brandon Hyde, who last month departed the organization to become manager of the Baltimore Orioles. Additionally, the Cubs have named Bob Tewksbury as coordinator, mental skills.  Loretta is a 15-year major league veteran who has spent the last nine seasons in the San Diego Padres front office upon retiring as a player in January, 2010, most recently as a special assistant, baseball operations. Loretta was a two-time All-Star infielder with the Padres (2004) and Boston Red Sox (2006) during his career with the Milwaukee Brewers (1995- 2002), Houston Astros (2002, 2007-08), Padres (2003-05), Red Sox (2006) and Los Angeles Dodgers (2009).  Loretta is a 1993 graduate of Northwestern University. He was drafted by the Brewers in the seventh round of the 1993 Draft and made his big league debut two years later. Loretta was a career .295 hitter (1,713-for-5,812) with 309 doubles, 76 home runs and 629 RBI in 1,726 major league games.  Tewksbury enters his 38th year in professional baseball, which includes 13 years as a major league pitcher and 15 years in mental skills. During his big league career, Tewksbury spent time with six different teams (1986-98), including parts of two seasons with the Cubs from 1987-88. He was an All-Star with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1992.  Upon retiring as a player, Tewksbury earned his B.S. in physical education from St. Leo University (2000) and his Master's of Education in Sport Psychology and Counseling from Boston University (2004). He spent 10 years as the Mental Skills coordinator for the Red Sox from 2004-13, was the Director of Player Development for the MLB Players Association in 2014, returned to the Red Sox for two seasons from 2015-16 and most recently served as mental performance coach for the San Francisco Giants from 2017-18.  — CUBS —

‘Wouldn’t have spoken about relationship if I had my way’  Basking in Bharat's success, Katrina Kaif on handling continuous scrutiny into her personal life  SONIL DEDHIA soni. dedhiat@mid-day.com  WITH her last release Bharat emerging as one of the biggest hits of the year so far and Zero (2018)  ning her critical acclaim, Katrina Kaif is enjoying a career-high. However, the actor's personal life con- tinues tobe under scrutiny — over three years after she parted ways with Ran- bir Kapoor, Kaif often finds herself fielding questions about her former flame. While she has maintained        a dignified stance about the break-up, she tells mid- day that she opened up on matters of the heart as she understood the demands of stardom.  “If Thad my way, [would have never spoken about my relationship. I chose to talk about it because the ‘media was interested in it couldn't have dodged the bullet every time. I would have sounded rude if I did that, So, the best thing was toshare the bare minimum, I wanted to, and be frank ‘enough to accept the reali-     ty. We [Kapoor and her} stil have respect for each other, and that will not change,” says Kaif,  ‘The actor adds thatwhile the heartbreak was one of, the toughest phases in her life, it helped her evolve as a person. “When I was going through separation, One of my sisters was also in the same reas ‘That's                                       when I realised that since my life was outin the open, the ego was more bruised, butatthe end of the day, we both felt the same pain. 1 found solaceinreading.

A Math Problem for the Minister of Education  The Ford government wants to revamp the math curriculum to focus on math fundamentals and steer away from "discovery math", Here's a word promen for the Minister of Education then:  An average high school class is 75 minutes in length. The government is removing the cap on class sizes so next year a class could have 38 students. If the teacher doesn't teach any lesson during a class and spends the entire time just speaks with each student individually:  a), How many minutes does the teacher have with each student if every student receives an ou amount of time? Round to 2 decimal places.  b). How many seconds is that per student?  c). it ways on how the teacher can effectively speak to students in that time about their progress in class, provide effective feedback, assess them using triangulation of data (conversations, observations, and products), assist with their emotional well- ing and mental health (anxiety, depression, etc.), accommodate for special needs, accommodate for English language learners, build a rapport with them and get to know oe or help them with any questions they ave.     | have provided the "old math" solutions to a). and b). using long division and long multiplication but c). really stumps me. Unfortunately, | don't know the answer to that one. | guess that makes me a lousy, underworked, and overpaid educator who doesn't care about the students. But hey, at least they'll mysteriously learn how to be "resilient" and learn "coping skills".  ~ An Ontario Teacher~

Amessage from  Dennis Muilenburg  Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer      This message is being sent to all Boeing employees.  Itwas with a heavy heart we leamed yesterday of the loss of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302—a feeling | know | share with all of you across Boeing. Tragedies like this affect the entire aerospace industry and remind us of our leadership role, our enduring commitment to safety—both at Boeing and industry-wide —and the importance of the work that we do to connect people around the world.  We extend our deepest sympathies to the families and loved ones of the passengers and crew on board. Our teams are fully supporting our customer and the investigation and providing technical assistance at the request and under the direction of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Ethiopian authorities. Though many questions remain at this time, we're committed to understanding all aspects of this accident.  | know this tragedy is especially challenging coming only months after the loss of Lion Air Flight 610. While dificult, | encourage everyone to stay focused on the important work we do. Our customers, business partners and stakeholders depend on us to deliver for them. While we concentrate on this serious matter, we're adjusting plans as appropriate to ensure the right people and resources are available when and where they need to be around the enterprise. Our objective is to ensure our teams are centered on our priorities, including safety, quality and stability. As an example, we've chosen to simplify our 777X rollout activities this week and postpone our external debut. We're also further strengthening the support to our 737 team and our ongoing production operations and customer service.  Boeing has delivered more than 370 737 MAX airplanes to 47 customers. Since its certification and entry into service, the MAX family has completed hundreds of thousands of flights safely. We are confident in the safety of the 737 MAX and in the work of the men and women who design and build it.  As we partner with regulators and the Ethiopian Airlines investigation unfolds, it's necessary that we stay centered on the facts and avoid speculation. As a reminder, all requests for information on this topic must flow through the proper channels. There are still many facts to learn and work to be done. ‘Speculating about the cause of the accident or discussing it without all the necessary facts is not appropriate and could compromise the integrity of the investigation.  In addition, Boeing follows international aviation protocol and cannot publicly release information related to the accident investigation. Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Kevin McAllister and | will continue to share information as details are available and it is appropriate to do so.  | believe in our people and the safety of our products and services. Thank you for always supporting each other, for your commitment to our customers and our industry's reputation, and for working together as a One Boeing team.  Dennis

Sittenfeld  Councilmember April 10, 2019  BACKGROUND  On Wednesday, March 13, 2019 the Ohio Senate passed Senate Bill 23, the so-called “Heartbeat Bill”, which is one of the most restrictive bans on access to reproductive medical care in the United States.  Senate Bill 23 would prevent patients from seeking an abortion as soon as 6 weeks after conception; threatens doctors with prison time and fines for performing duties in their capacity as a reproductive medical professional; and has no exceptions for rape or incest.  On Wednesday, April 10, 2019 - the Ohio House of Representatives will take up Senate Bill 23, where it is expected to pass. Governor Dewine has committed to sign the legislation into law.  MOTION  WE MOVE that the City Law Department prepare and file an amicus curiae brief with State or Federal courts alongside any challenge to the constitutionality of Ohio Senate Bill 23.  WE FURTHER MOVE that it is a policy priority of the Cincinnati City Council that the State of Ohio should not impose hardships on those seeking access to reproductive medical care.

Emily  To me you are a work of art.  Your eyes wander, wide, expectant. You hands grasp and fumble,  A word forms but tumbles into nonsense.  But it's our nonsense, it's our time. You look at me, | weep for your excellence,  You are all the joy, all the world.  My hand is taken, my heart pauses. Your smile cracks the stone.  To open my heart, you have to break it. | Let you in, | am your prisoner.  Born to us through the top of the world,  Allis new, all is wonder, none is familiar.  Running with you, tiny, glorious girl, Holding you aloft, the sun over your shoulder.  My eyes burn, your arms around me, Bottle this moment, the naysayers can LI=TaVZ=¥  The birds fight against the wind,  The world still turns, turns just for you.  Over the horizon we will all be there, Life will continue, you'll stand to my shoulders.  You'll overtake me on wheels of fury, You'll shut the bedroom door in angst, You'll rage against the world,  The child will be the woman.  The memories will be warm and ours.            am _ ee 1 8) od reenter

Earlier this afternoon Premier Ford accepted the resignation of his Chief of Staff, Dean French. Mr. French informed the Premier that he will be returning to the private sector after a successful first year of government, as he had always planned.  Mr. French served the Premier's Office during a successful transition to power and a first year that saw the setting in motion of more than 85% of the Premier's election commitments and the passing of 20 pieces of major legislation. Mr. French also played a key leadership role that helped create an environment for Ontario once again becoming open for business leading to the creation of more than 190,000 new jobs.  "| want personally thank Dean for his hard work, his leadership and his friendship. He is leaving our government in a very strong position from where we can build upon our successes and continue delivering on our priorities for the people of Ontario," stated Premier Ford. "Dean's legacy will be that of leading a historic and successful election campaign last year, as well as the incredible successes we have had in our government's first year. On behalf of the Government of Ontario, | wish Dean the very best in his future.”

DANBURY, Conn., May 2.—Despite the continued efforts of- the trainmen to put him off,a small Maltesecat rode from the Grand Central Station in New Yorx to Danbury yesterday on the bumpers of a Passenger train. The cat, ‘“‘Hink’ by     name, has been a pet for some time among the railroad men, being a regular hanger-  on about the Grand Central Station, where he amused himself from morning to night by riding out of the station for a mile or  SO on one train, jumping off and catching  a ride hact on the nert train coming in.

Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; [nor] for the arrow [that] flieth by day; 2Tim. 1:17, Rom. 8:15-16, Psa. 23:4  1. Father | thank You because You are not the author of confusion. Thank You for  the revelation of Your word through our Daddy G.O.  2. As a member of RCCG, | refuse to fear because God has not given us the spirit of fear. 3. | bind the spirit of fear in my life in the name of Jesus.  4. | break every evil covenant that has brought or may bring fear into my life in this year in the name of Jesus.  5. 1 command every terror of the night that has brought fear into my life to stop in  the name of Jesus.  6. You spirit of fear, loose your hold upon my life and my family in the name of Jesus. 7.1 command all human agents using the spirit of fear to terrify me during the day or at night to stumble and fall in the name of Jesus.  8. The fear of unbelievers shall not be my portion this year in the name of Jesus.  9. | bind every spirit responsible for the fear of tomorrow in my heart in the name of Jesus. 10. | close every negative door of fear in my life in the name of Jesus.  Tl. | decree that every sickness, disease, oppression and depression in my life as a result of fear disappears in the name of Jesus.  12. As a member of RCCG, | receive my divine boldness as a lion in the name of Jesus.  OOOO e@TheHGservice |

You'll meet me in the light  IT know that you can't see me, but trust me I'm right here, Although I'm up in heayen, my love for you stays near.  So often I see you crying,  many times you call my name.  I want so much to lick your face and ease some of your pain.  I wish that I could make you see that Heaven indeed is real.  If you could see me run and play how much better you would feel,        But our loving God has promised me that when the time is right,  you'll step out of the darkness and meet me in the light.

San Jose City Council Approves Mayor Liccardo’s Proposals to Aid Tenants and Federal Employees Impacted by Shutdown  Council unanimously adopts an urgency ordinance to protect San Joseans from eviction during the federal shutdown and an interest-free loan program for San Jose Airport staff working without pay.  San Jose, Calif. ~ Today, the San Jose City Council approved an urgency ordinance that establishes a 90-day moratorium on evictions for non-payment of rent for tenants affected by the Trump-forced federal government shutdown and a short-term, no-interest loan program for vital federal employees currently working without pay at Mineta San Jose International Airport.  “With today’s votes, we have taken action to protect our residents who rely on the federal government to keep their homes and to ensure the safe operation of our airport,” said Mayor Sam Liccardo. “We are doing everything in ‘our power to keep the political dysfunction in Washington from severely disrupting the lives of our residents.”  In approving the urgency ordinance, San Jose immediately establishes a 90-day moratorium on evictions for non- payment of rent for tenants who receive a federal housing voucher — for instance Section 8 including Veteran's Administration Supportive Housing Vouchers (VASH) ~ or are federal employees or contractors who are unpaid due to the shutdown. If the shutdown ends before 90 days, then the moratorium will expire 30 days from the end of the shutdown.  ‘The City Council also gave final approval to an interest-free loan program for the approxmalty 500 federal ‘employees ~ air traffic controllers, TSA security employees, and Customs officers - who are being forced to work without pay. Under the program, the City will partner with Technology Credit Union (TechCU) to disperse loans equivalent to the take-home pay of San Jose’s federal airport employees. The program will be up and running next week.

‘A beautiful team performance’ England 5-0 Czech Republic      England hat-trick scorer Raheem Sterling, speaking to ITV: "it was a beautiful team performance and | was happy to help the team get the win. I'm just being confident in myself, I'm trying to get in areas and take shots, not to worry about anything.  The first goal pleased me most, to get myself up and running."  On his tribute to Damary Dawkins, a Crystal Palace youth- team player who died from leukaemia on Sunday: "Damary was a kid | was trying to help and we thought we'd found a donor. Sadly it didn't match and sadly he passed away, so | wanted to give his family something to smile about."

Bitcoin v0.1 released  Satoshi Nakamoto satoshi at vistomail.com_ Thu Jan 8 14:27:40 EST 2009       * Previous message: [tmoore at seas harvard edu: [fe-announce] Financial Crypto February Barbados, Early Registration Deadline Approaching]  ‘ext message: MDS considered harmful today, SHA-1 considered harmful tomorrow  * Messages sorted by: [date ] [thread ] [subject ] [author ]       Announcing the first release of Bitcoin, a new electronic cash system that uses a peer-to-peer network to prevent double-spending. It's completely decentralized with no server or central authority.  See bitcoin.org for screenshots.  Dounload Link: htte://dounloads sourceforge net/bitcoin/bitcoin-0.1,0.rar  Windows only for now. Open source C++ code is included.  = Unpack the files into a directory = Run BITCOIN.EXE - It automatically connects to other nodes  If you can keep a node running that accepts incoming connections, you'll really be helping the network a lot. Port 8333 on your Firewall needs to be open to receive incoming connections.  The software is still alpha and experimental. There's no guarantee the system's state won't have to be restarted at some point if it becomes necessary, although I've done everything I can to build in extensibility and versioning.  You can get coins by getting someone to send you some, or turn on Options->Generate Coins to run a node and generate blocks. I made the proof-of-work difficulty ridiculously easy to start with, so for a little while in the beginning a typical PC will be able to generate coins in just a few hours. It'll get a lot harder when Competition makes the automatic adjustment drive up the difficulty. Generated coins must wait 120 blocks to mature before they can be spent.  There are two ways to send money. If the recipient is online, you can enter their IP address and it will connect, get a new public key and send the transaction with comments. If the recipient is not online, it is possible to send to their Bitcoin address, which is a hash of their public key that they give you. They'll receive ‘the transaction the next time they connect and get the block it's in. This method has the disadvantage that no comment information is sent, and a bit of privacy may be lost if the address is used multiple times, but it is a useful alternative if both users can't be online at the same time or the recipient can’t receive incoming connections.  Total circulation will be 21,000,000 coins. It'll be distributed to network nodes when they make blocks, with the amount cut in half every 4 years.  First 4 years: 10,500,000 coins next 4 years: 5,250,000 coins next 4 years: 2,625,000 coins next 4 years: 1,312,500 coins eters  When that runs out, the system can support transaction fees if needed. It's based on open market competition, and there will probably always be nodes willing to process transactions for free.

A federal grand jury in Wheeling on Tuesday indicted 25-year-old Taryn Corrinne Henthorn of Middlebourne.  Prosecutors say Henthorn made the threat on Facebook and elsewhere last month.  Henthorn faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each of three counts if convicted.

The UK "rewards laziness", does not encourage risk-taking and must strive to emulate the work ethic and low-tax culture in parts of Asia, the five MPs argue in a book due out next month  The authors include Elizabeth Truss and Dominic Raab, both tipped to be promoted in a future reshuffle     "Too many people in Britain prefer a lie-in to hard work,” they argue  The other contributors to Britannia Unchained are Priti Patel, Chris Skidmore and Kwasi Kwarteng, influential members of the “class of 2010" - MPs elected to Parliament at the last election.

Assaults at aged care facility; carer charged — Warilla Wednesday, 02 January 2019 04:49:40 PM.  Acarer has been charged over several alleged assaults of residents at an aged care facility in the Lake Illawarra region.  Police will allege the carer, a 48-year-old woman, assaulted five residents — three women and two men — aged between 74 and 87 — at an aged care facility on Arcadia Street, Warilla.  The incidents allegedly occurred between October and December 2018.  Following inquiries, detectives from Lake Illawarra Police District arrested a 48-year-old woman at a home in Mount Warrigal, just before 10am today (Wednesday 2 January 2019).  She was taken to Lake Illawarra Police Station and charged with five counts of assault.

Americana music is the island of the misfit toys. I am such a misfit. It is this music that has shaped my life and made me who I am, and even given me my family. I came out of the closet at 15-years-old when I was in high school, and I can assure you I was never invited to any parties. I never got to attend a dance. To be embraced by this loving and enduring community has been the dance of a lifetime. Thank you for being my island.

(-] 4# Riflemantax 402 points 6 hours ago  ‘You know what fucking sucks? When you're a divisional rival, and you can’t legitimately hate on the team. You just feel fucking awful for the fan base.  No one deserves this shit. I wouldn’t wish this shit on Cowboys fans. I might not think highly of Jerrah’s GM skills, but he genuinely gives a shit about his fan base and puts serious effort into putting out a good product.  Don’t care much for the Giants either, but the Mara family gives a fuck.  Dan Snyder has become a punchline. His mismanagement- and its being polite to use such a lesser descriptive word- has started to take a toll on the game, not just the team. I want to roll into a game day thread and be all ‘HEY, FUCK YOU!" and have rowdy Skins fans be all ‘YES, YES, FUCK YOU TOO!”  It’s one thing to have a perennial bad team. Eagles fans, or at least the older ones have been there. Browns fans have been there. Bills fans have been there. These fan bases still turn out week after week, slamming each other through tables and throwing dildos on the field. Or at least the Bills fans do that. We prefer snowballs and batteries.  But when your fan base is so defeated by ownership and mismanagement that the opposing team turns the game into a home game, well... you can’t just blame that on a few injuries, no matter how key they are.  The shitty thing is, short of some heinous conduct, I don't see what action the NFL could even take.  pe ee Be ea

Dear Cowgirl Basketball Fans,  THE PAST 16 YEARS HAVE BEEN AN AMAZING JOURNEY FOR THE WYOMING WOMEN’S BASKETBALL PROGRAM and for me, personally. In May of 2003, I was appointed the Head Basketball ‘i ah Coach for the University of Wyoming. The years have seen more highs than lows, < ‘ cH and we were able to move from playing in front of a few hundred Wyoming fans to sg  thousands over that time. The highlight being the WNIT Championship and a “sellout” of the AA. I have made the decision to retire as the head coach of this great institution. It is nice to be able to make this choice at this time in my life. I am truly indebted to the administration, support staff, coaches and players that made Cowgirl basketball such a success. Finally, the Wyoming fans have embraced Jamie and 1, truly making Wyoming a special place to live and work.                    Twish the University of Wyoming, the Wyoming Athletic Department and Specifically Cowgirl basketball all the best in the future.  FOREVER A COWGIRL! ae  ~Joe Legerski  a

LIB renee  Hey so, French person here. And also an ex History student. 'm here to say: Please listen to 0.p. above.  Obviously everyone is shocked but here's a few important key facts:  ‘+The roofs completely gone. Part of it dated back from the 13th century but the rest was from the 19th. The stone arch roof under the top roof is fine,  ‘One of the three main stained glass rose windows has fallen out. Most of the other stained glass windows are okay.  + The spire has fallen down and that's the saddest part. BUT! It was in the process of being restored and the 16 statues that were there were removed just four days agol So they're fine.  ‘The main structure is stil here and nothing has “burned down’ unlike what some people have been saying.  + The “treasure’ (sacred objects) is safe  Notre Dame is still there. I's just damaged. Almost nothing was lost today, and nobody was wounded either. it's scary, but i's gonna be okay.

ENOUGH IS ENOUGH





lll just address it head-on, and then we can get to the soccer questions. Obviously, a lot of news recently. | stand by the comments | made about not wanting to go to the White House — with the exception of the expletive, my mom will be very upset about that.  But | think, obviously, entering with a lot of passion, considering how much time and effort and pride we take in the platform that we have, and using it for good and for leaving the game in a better place, and hopefully the world in a better place.  | don’t think that | would want to go, and | would encourage my teammates to think hard about lending that platform or having that co-opted by an administration that doesn’t feel the same way and doesn’t fight for the same things that we fight for.  So I'll just leave it at that, and I’m not interested in answering any of those questions. We can get to the real reason we’re here, which is a huge game.

Based purely on day-to-day clinical experience, we knew the fitness to work tests were triggering significant mental health problems and the concrete evidence to support this steadily mounting. The first example of the WCA process being blamed directly for a completed suicide came in a coroner’s report in 2015 after Michael O’Sullivan, a 60-year-old man, had his Employment Support Allowance (ESA) discontinued despite providing reports from three doctors stating that he had long-term depression and agoraphobia and was therefore unable to work. He killed himself at his home on 24 September 2013.  His suicide is amongst hundreds that have now been ruled as       antidepressants and 279,000 additional cases of self-reported psychiatric problems.

The failed coup in Venezuela [2002] was closely tied to senior officials in the US government.  The Bush administration immediately endorsed the new government under businessman Pedro Carmona.  But the coup was sent dramatically into reverse after 48 hours. Officials at the Organisation of American States assert that the US administration was not only aware the coup was about to take place, but had sanctioned it, presuming it to be destined for success.

Fifty-seven per cent of stargazers struggled to see more than 10 stars, while only 2% said they experienced “truly dark skies” enabling them to count more than 30, according to the research by the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE).  People in towns and the country- side were encouraged to count how many stars they could see with the naked eye within the constellation of Orion, which is visible only in the winter months.

The racketeering conspiracy included eight murders, drug trafficking, and witness intimidation.  The sentencing was announced by Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department's Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur for the District of Maryland; Special Agent in Charge Gordon B. Johnson of the FBI Baltimore Field Office; Acting Commissioner Michael Harrison of the Baltimore Police Department; Special Agent in Charge Rob Cekada of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Baltimore Field Division; Assistant Special Agent in Charge Don A. Hibbert of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Baltimore District Office; Anne Arundel County Police Chief Tim Altomare and Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn J. Mosby.  Montana Barronette, aka Tana, and Tanner, 23, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Catherine C. Blake for the District of Maryland to serve life in prison, followed by five years of supervised release. The racketeering conspiracy included eight murders — six committed by Barronette — as well as drug trafficking and witness intimidation. Barronette and his co-defendants were also convicted of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute heroin, marijuana, and cocaine. A federal jury convicted Barronette and seven co- defendants on Oct. 31, 2018.  https:/Awwwjustice.gov/opa/pr/leader-violent- west-baltimore-gang-sentenced-life-prison- federal-racketeering-and-drug

This may be a trite, rep-  etitious warning, but this time it is going to happen. We have arrived atthe space where indoc- trination has beaten logic.  We want an economy that has no baseload power but does have cheap power.  We export uranium but refuse touseit.  We makelittletonothing, but close down export markets such       bourne and Brisbane are con- gested —well, suck itup, because more people from God knows what country are on their way. They will come because they want to and under the circum- stances they choose.  Dont dare say the words “son” or “daughter” — they are nowtobe neuterpeople.  The right of the objecting in- dividual will reign supreme over the complacent, polite broader body.  The Greens-Labor-indepen- dent alliance has its philosophi- cal totem which it enforces by guilt to place more caveats over your assets and more imposi- tionsover your income streams.  You havealready fallen fort.  You stood by and let farmers be dispossessed of their veg- etation rights because of global warming.  You must buy power only from the prescribed source be- cause of global warming.  You will buy cars of their pre- scription because of global  going to be sung to yor months.  ‘The Labor Party will quiet game.

tzuyu cookie - 1dayago Who wants SVT to win in Inkigayo for the 1st time? Pls read this ¢  Inkigayo criteria is 50-55% digitals, 5% album, 35% MV views, the rest is voting/ broadcast. For digitals, it will be hard since there's some digitally strong artists, but we have to do decently, especially  in Melon. Home has a good chance of doing good digitally since it's a somehow slong song. For albums, we'll top that. For broadcast/voting, this is mainly for korean fans so pls encourage more k- carats. For MVs, this is where I-carats can give it all out. We have to stream hard  so we can get at least 30-35% in the MV criteria. If we top the voting, album & MV criteria, & do better in Melon, we'll get our Inkigayo 1st Win.

Ford CEO Mark Fields called the move “a vote of confidence” in Trump, but primarily a response to a decline in North American demand for small cars like those that would have been made at the Mexican plant. He said Ford would have made the same decision even if Trump had not been elected.  Ford will cancel plans unveiled in April to spend $1.6 billion to build the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, a project Trump urged the automaker to abandon and called an “absolute disgrace” during the election campaign.  The No. 2 U.S. automaker also said it would invest $700 million to expand the Flat Rock, Michigan factory and would make new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles there.  Trump's efforts to browbeat the U.S. car industry show he may go further than other modern presidents to try to influence corporate decisions, especially those related to trade and investment.  http:/ecomputerzone.com/ford-cancels-a-1-6- billion-mexico-plant-and-adds-700-jobs-in- michigan/

BUSINESS REVIEW  ROBERT GOTTLIEBSEN     ATO whistleblower Richard Boyle pays the price  Arguably Australia’s most significant whistleblower, the man who forced both our major political parties to alter their small business taxation appeal policies, is now set to face a court battle. That’s the cost of being a whistleblower.  Thanks to Boyle’s courage and sense of national interest, the major Australian political parties finally realised that the small business appeal system had to change. The ALP announced a policy to give persecuted small business a chance to lodge a fair appeal. The ALP system was not perfect, but it was far better than the current regime where there is no effective affordable appeal (large enterprises can afford the court appeal system which works). The ATO recently settled a substantial sum on a family who had been a beneficiary of the governments research grants. The move by the ATO destroyed the business and the family home was lost. That family received outside held to fight the ATO and win. Most taxpaying small enterprises that can’t raise the money lose their homes and business. They have no affordable appeal.

The first 100 days                                1 Agree/develop a modus operandi with your supervisor(s) (e.g. agree where and how often you expect to meet, how to assess progress when the supervisor is away, the different types of feedback expected etc.)  2 Take responsibility for arranging meetings with your supervisor, and provide an agenda in advance of the meeting, ideally with a few short explanatory notes about each topic.  3. Write a project plan listing some key initial research objectives and preliminary deadlines (at least).  4 Produce a Gantt chart based on the above for your project activities for the first, say, 6 months.  5 Read selected journal articles, take notes and write a short literature review (even a few thousand words).  6 Get feedback from your supervisor(s) on this literature review; on your writing style and how to improve it where necessary: on whether you have read the right articles and; whether you are understanding the knowledge and uncertainties associated with your topic.  7 Read recent PhD theses in your topic to see what is ultimately expected of you.  8 Learn and practice new research methods that you will need to use - before you start your research,  9 Develop good professional habits for keeping all your information and data safe and organised.  10 Formally or informally review your skills (probably with your supervisor) and do a self-assessment of your training needs.     46  THINKWELL

Coinspeaker: “And what about EOS? Are there any fundamental differences and why developers should go to TRON?”  Justin Sun: “EOS cost a lot more money to developers. It’s easy to port applications from Ethereum to TRON (that’s why we followed  Ethereum’s development path), but not so for EOS. For app developers who don't have a lot of money, they have to decide whether they should stake their future on the EOS platform.”

weapons paid for by you and |. Sad!     hanley alexander 4 hours ago te)  Here we go again. Jason Rezaian relying on an article by an Iranian apologist who himself has relied on three exposed and notorious agents of Tehran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security, Hassan Heyrani, Reza Sadeghi and Massoud Khodabandeh, as well as a reporter-for-hire Aaron Reza Merat, to regurgitate Tehran's lies and slanders against the main Iranian opposition. Let the Post's readers, and for that matter its editors, be made aware that Rezaian is the same guy having fun "in the the bed of the pick-up truck" (Nightlife in Tehran, The New York Times, June 9, 2009) loaded with the murderous members of the Iranian regime's paramilitary bassij back in 2009, when the mullahs crushed the 2009 uprising. A couple of days after Rezaian's gloating remarks in praise of the Bassijis, one of them shot Neda Agha-Soltan in broad daylight. The video clip of her tragic bleeding to death went viral. And Rezaian is the same person who, on August 2, 2014, signed a statement, while claiming to be a journalist, along with 36 discredited diehard Iran apologists, arguing against the delisting of the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK) Uoint Experts’ Statement on the Mujahedin-e Khalg, the Financial Times, Aug. 10, 2011). Ironically, after his release from prison was bought and paid for with 4.7 billion dollars in cash delivered on pallets to the criminal gang of thugs who rule Iran, Rezaian has used his column in the Post to write more propaganda against the group that has opposed his captors and his incarceration, than the captors themselves. Go figure!

‘To love. To be loved. To never forget your own insignificance. To never get used to the Myre ests violence and the vulgar disparity of life around you. To seek joy in the saddest places. To pursue beauty to its lair. To never simplify what is complicated  or complicate what is simple. To respect strength, never power. Above all, to watch.  To try and understand. To never look  away. And never, never to forget:  ARUNDHATI ROY, from “The End of Imagination’

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE February 5, 2019  Statement from Michael Coteau, MPP for Don Valley East  Today we heard about Doug Ford's plan to cut autism services and implement an arbitrary age cap.  This is not what parents want. This is not what experts say is right. This is wrong  Ford's funding cap will not come close to providing the care that young people truly need. Further, ending funding for service providers will devastate the capacity of the system, making suburban, rural, and Northem communities wait longer for services.  Support needs to be flexible, individualized and based on the needs, strengths, and goals of young people with autism and their families. An arbitrary cut-off based on age will not provide this. It will cause confusion and create greater financial struggles for families. They will not be able to afford the services that they need  As the former Minister of Children and Youth Services, | worked with parents and experts to radically overhaul the autism system in Ontario with more funding and more flexibility for parents. We weren't perfect, but we listened to parents and made significant progress. Our road map to further improve the Ontario Autism Program was ready and waiting for the new government and they failed to implement it.  While | don't doubt the sincerity of many in the government to improve autism services, today's news is throwing away the hard work done to build a better, fairer and more equitable system for families. | will continue to work closely with families and fight against cuts and arbitrary age cut-offs being made by the Conservative Government  -30-  For media inquiries please contact.

If you don’t think this is going to have massive impacts on students (YOUR CHILDREN), you are insane.  Not just academically, either. You can likely say good bye to all extra- curriculars - sports teams, music, theatre, outdoor club, extra free tutoring, etc.  You can also say goodbye to meaningful instruction time because we will be spending our time solely on behaviour management when students are packed in classrooms like sardines with no personal space.

CLEVELAND BROWNS 2019 SCHEDULE
In 1991, Robson, his mother, Joy, and his sister Chantelle moved to LA and he was almost immediately cast in three of Jackson's videos -- including Black or White.  He was later signed to Jackson's private label as half of a short-lived rap duo, Quo.  Over the years, Robson said, Jackson bought him instruments and encouraged him in their friendship, which, according to the 187cm rising star, was always "creatively based”  “His initial interest in me was because of my dancing. He saw the talent and the spark | had inside me and all he has ever wanted to do is just help my career,” he said.  Asked if he had ever slept in Jackson's bed, Robson said: "Yeah, but nothing strange happened.”  Robson said he didn't think it was "weird" that a grown man would share the same bed as a child.  “Everything in life is so complex. He just wanted something around that was simple -- to hang with kids," he said.  "The biggest thing you have to understand is that he has no concept of reality.  "He has been a superstar since he was five years old.  “| mean, what concept does he have of what society thinks is right?"  Robson said he no longer saw Jackson as often as he did as a child -- maybe | will talk to him every six months -- but he would always remain a friend. "| will always support him and whatever happens is supposed to happen -- | hope it works out for him," he said.  “It is sad to see."

"By means of ever more effective methods of mind-manipulation, the democracies will change their nature; the quaint old forms -- elections, parliaments, Supreme Courts and all the rest -- will remain.  The underlying substance will be a new kind of totalitarianism. All the traditional names, all the hallowed slogans will remain exactly what they were in the good old days. Democracy and freedom will be the theme of every broadcast and editorial. Meanwhile the ruling oligarchy and its highly trained elite of soldiers, policemen, thought-manufacturers and mind-manipulators will quietly run the show as they see fit."  Aldous Huxley

Trump told advisers Friday morning that he was glad he didn’t go forward with the strikes.  He also claimed on Twitter that new sanctions had been imposed on Iran on Thursday night. But officials said later Friday that no new measures had been imposed.  The whipsaw approach left some in Congress concerned that the president didn’t have a clear strategy for managing relations with Iran.

It is with great sadness that we report the passing of Mike White, a retired Michigan State Police Trooper and Team Chaplain for the Central Michigan Football program. Mike was a loyal and dedicated member of our team for many years and the impact he made on every member of our program throughout those years is truly immeasurable.  He lived his life as a faithful servant and had an incredible gift for connecting with people of all backgrounds. We will always remember Mike’s infectious smile, his positive energy, and his passion for helping others. His legacy will live on through the countless lives he touched and in the hearts and minds of the Central Michigan family.  We are extremely grateful for Mike’s years of service  to our community and our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time.  edd | FOOTBALL B

Iwas chatting to the team this morning and the current delay is understanding when we can implement what it is we have in development.  If it's coming soon, we will be in a good place to into more detail. If it's coming later, we may hold back some of that detail as we are conscious that we could change things around before it makes it to a live build.

Northg99 @wearenorth99  The Ontario Chamber of Commerce and the Fraser Institute claimed a $14 minimum wage would kill jobs in Ontario.  What happened? Ontario employment grew by 1.1% in 2018, faster than the national average.  The facts are clear - a higher minimum wage is good for workers

Cardin Bill to Provide Back Pay for Furloughed Federal Workers is Signed into Law  “Now that we are guaranteeing pay to the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have been locked out of their jobs, let's reopen the government and get them all back to work so American taxpayers can receive the services they need and are paying for”  WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.), author of . 24, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act, issued the following statement after President Trump signed the bill into law Wednesday,  “Twenty-six days into the federal government shutdown, we are bringing some long-term relief to furloughed workers, but we still need to reopen the government immediately. The promise of back pay will not cover the cost of rent or groceries today. It won't make a car payment or cover prescriptions. This needless shutdown is having a painful effect on hundreds of thousands of  workers, their families and their communities.  “Federal workers are dedicated public servants who shouldn't continue to suffer. Many of them are working dangerous jobs without knowing when their next paycheck may come. Many others are being forcibly furloughed and unable to carry out their mission — because of the government shutdown. Now that we are guaranteeing pay to the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have been locked out of their jobs, let’s reopen the government and get them all back to work so American taxpayers can receive the services they need and are paying for. Only once the government is open again, can we have a reasonable discussion about border security and the  issues at the heart of the current shutdown.”  HHH

These are the Central Park Five. In 1989, they were falsely charged with violently assaulting and raping a female jogger in NYC. Donald Trump famously called for them to be EXECUTED. They spent between six and 13 years in prison, only to be fully exonerated after DNA evidence proved someone else was guilty. They sued NYC and got $41 million in restitution, which Trump called "ridiculous." America, is Trump's judament the kind we want in the White House?

AM a a a eT  y Z Better Solution of Bloekchain Trilemm     For public chain, there exists a blockchain trilemma problem: itis very difficult to design a blockchain system which can satisfy decentralization, security, and scalability at the same time. Especially, the scalability problem is one of the most difficult parts in the development of blockchain technology. Many projects provided their own solutions, and state sharding is the most  efficient and difficult solution to achieve.  QuarkChain uses state sharding technology and a system structure of root ee  chain-shards which can compatible with various consensus mechanisms. On the basis of high throughput, more than 51% hash power will be protected by  nua ~a AR  root-chain, and compatible with decentralized PoW, PoS, and other consensus mechanisms. It puts forward an excellent solution to blockchain trilemma, which is an important contribution to the future development of the industry.  , a ff fF fF A

If you are living in California, there is always the lesson of how Michigan came to be governed by a more centrist government. Of course, that came after the failure of the prior government. For now, however, for all its concern for sustainable foods and products, California is on a high-speed rail to unsustainability."  #FactsMatter  Q

Letter to our PM from a PPCLI Soldier  Gord Hockridge is the man who wrote this letter. If you want to share it, please do so and congratulate him.  He is Canadian and he stands for our values  Mr. Prime Minister of Canada     Justin Trudeau, when | joined the military, | swore allegiance to God, Queen and Country. | have never forsaken that oath. You have attacked all three of those very precious entities | swore to honour and protect. You and your party were legally voted into office (I think).  However, that does not give you carte blanche to completely change Canada into a country aligned with the United Nations, Social Justice Warriors and globalists. Canadian values you often speak about are not the values of most Canadians. Tell us sir, if you could form your very own global government,  how would it govern? Certainly not by a democracy. A democracy requires free thinkers, a free people. A global government can only be governed....no,  ruled, by a dictatorship, much like your favourite country, China, where  elites will be at the top and hard-working people like myself relegated as  mere worker bees doing the bidding of elites like you. You have attacked  free speech, even legislated against it. You have ignored our border  security, thus making Canada a less safe place to live. You have manipulated the mainstream media, you cater to known and convicted terrorists, while denigrating veterans. You have grossly mismanaged Canadians’ hard earned tax money. You are tampering with the election system and you are blindly following the actions of the EU on immigration knowing full well what that  has done to Europe, yet you insist in taking Canada over the proverbial  cliff with them. Why? In preparation for globalism? That can be the only  answer. What is your end game Mr. PM?  Please have the intestinal fortitude to explain during question period to all of Canada, just what you and your “liberal” party plan to do with this great nation. Make no mistake, Canada is a great nation, though in the last three years has been battered and assaulted by you and outside forces undermining freedom and sovereignty.  Mr. Trudeau you are my Prime Minister in name only.     Anyone who wishes to drag Canada into third world status, dismar freedom, surrender Her sovereignty and desecrate those who sacrificed to  make Canada a great nation is indeed my enemy. You sir, and your far- left  party are fast becoming my enemy. Unlike your ANTIFA pals, I don't hide  behind a mask; my name is at the bottom of this letter. You see Justin,  that's what free people and people with integrity do. They stand up against tyranny, they don't ignore it or hide from it. History shows us that  oppressed people address tyranny in every possible way required to preserve freedom and sovereignty. In closing, | always knew Canada had enemies, but | never thought the most dangerous enemy this country would ever face would be its own government. As the saying goes; I'd rather die on my feet than live  on my are underestimating the intelligence and resolve of     Canadians.  Gord Hockridge

(ver at Vanderwell Contractors, things are net looking as dire as you might have thought, given the hullabelloo over the softwood lumber duties imposed by the U.S. late last year. Another litle known fact: they don't add up to much more than Alberta producers were paying anyway under the old agreement"There was @ surcharge of 20 per cent when we exceeded a threshold in 9 month? says general manager Ken Vanderwell. And we almost alveys did'The surcharge was not just on whetever amount of Alberte lumber exceeded the monthly quota,  “ities retroactive, back tothe last stick” he says. So at around 22 per cent, under the new regime, things aren’ that much different. The bg loserin ether scenario, Vanderwell says isthe US. lumber customer “its crested an artificially high price of lumber inthe U.S. market? he says.  Trade issues aside, 2017 was 8 pretty good year for the lumber mil, Prices were et @ 1Syear high, Vanderwell says, and he's hopeful 2018 will continue strong, Several factors have gone into the good prices for umber hurricanes in the U.S. last year is one; forest fires in B.C. i another. Mountain pine beetle also  continues to help the price by making less wood available. Finally, housing starts in the U.S. have strengthened generally, after several years of being below average,

They even gave Ronaldo that "Second Best" nickname until CR7 transformed into a serial European conqueror whilst Messi remains a Local Champion. Look, both Ronaldo and Messi are OUT of the UCL this year. But you can't deny the fact that Messi's exit is disgraceful whereas Ronaldo's wasn't. After the 1st leg - where Leo was formidable indeed - the media were chanting, "This is Messi's Era"... which era? the era of seating on his couch to watch Ronaldo lift 4 of  @BreatheRonaldo  BIAS MEDIA EXPOSED

Office of the Press Secretary     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January 17, 2019  Letter from President Donald J. Trump to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi     THE WHITE HOUSE  WASHINGTON  January 17,2019  The Honorable Nancy Pelosi Speaker of the  House of Representatives Washington, D.C. 20515  Dear Madame Speaker:  Due to the Shutdown, I am sorry to inform you that your trip to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan has been postponed. We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the Shutdown is over. In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate. | also feel that, during this period, it would be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me and joining the Strong Border Security movement to end the Shutdown. Obviously, if you would like to make your journey by flying commercial, that would certainly be your prerogative.         look forward to seeing you soon and even more forward to watching our open and dangerous Southern Border finally receive the attention, funding, and security it so desperately deserves!

oo RCCG FASTING (WORLDWIDE)  MONDAY, Iith Feb. 2019  DAY 32: THE FEAR OF GOD AND HEALINGS 1. Thank God for a new day and for the salvation of your soul.  2. Father, enable me to have a grand vision of You that | might fear You, that | might tremble in Your presence.  3. Father; help me to know that You're not merely a Redeemer but also a Judge; not merely a God of love, but also a consuming fire.  4. Father; help me not play around with sin, not just because of its consequences, but  also because it grieves You.  5. Father give us the grace to be effective in soul winning this year in the name of Jesus.  6. Father, help us to be faithful in giving our first fruit, tithes and offering throughout  this Year in the name of Jesus.  7. Father, cause each of Your children to shine brightly in this land, Lord. Let each light take its place on a lamp stand and draw others to You. May those without Christ see our good works and glorify You in the name of Jesus. Isaiah 60:1  8. Father, please give our leaders wisdom, knowledge and discernment, for the things coming from You in the name of Jesus. Daniel 2:21  9. Father, give us visions of Your holiness and justice that will make us tremble at your Word in the name of Jesus.  10. Father, help us that we may serve you with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Psalm 2:11 11. Father, we pray for Your Kingdom to come. May Your will be done in our nation as It  is In heaven. Let righteousness, salvation, and truth define our lives, our marriages, our homes and communities in the name of Jesus. Matthew 6:10  12. Lord, You promised that the gates of hell will not overcome Your church. Lord, please s trengthen Your church in this country. Let us rise to the battle cry and faithfully  stand firm! Stir up our passions and desires for purity, holiness, and intimacy  with You. Let us walk in the unquenchable fire of Your Spirit in the name of Jesus. Matthew 16:18  OOOO e@TheHGservice |

camrenbicondova @dresilence His name is David and talented and kind. No one else could play Gotham’s Bruce Wayne. Obviously your jealousy takes over because you wish you were a teenage boy ona successful tv show. Step back and look at yourself and what you want out of life and figure out what you can do to achieve it. Rather than spewing hatred through a screen toward someone that deserves nothing but love and appreciation. Let alone, you probably wouldn't have the guts to say all that negative stuff to his face.

Monday, June 17th - Hangover Day! We know everyone is “suffering” from a bit of an EarpExpo  hangover today so why not put it to good use? Today’s theme  is HANGOVER. How would each of our #WynonnaEarp  characters deal with their own hangover? Let IDW know how YOU think each character would cope the morning after a wild  bonfire party at the Earp Homestead.  And why not post some of your EarpExpo photos while you are  at it.  Tuesday, June 18th - Road Trip Day | know we ALL wanted to go on that road trip down to Austin  that Nicole mentioned in War Paint, so why not take today to  let IDW know where YOU would go if you were road tripping  with your favorite #WynonnaEarp characters. Down the street, across the border, or any other location that you can dream up.  Let’s hit the road, Earp style!  Wednesday, June 19th - Ode to Earp Slam poetry, love sonnet, haiku jotted down on a crumpled beer napkin... Today is poetry day. Tell IDW what  #WynonnaEarp means to you in a poem. Make it fun, make it sappy, make it full of unicorns and rainbows, just have some  fun with it!  Thursday, June 20th - Arrested Development  It's finally happened (let's be real, you KNEW it would), you and your favorite #WynonnaEarp character(s) have been arrested and tossed in the PSD holding cell. You have ONE phone call. Who would you call and what is your ‘crime?’  Tell IDW your #Wynonna Earp arrest story.  Friday, June 21st - What Would Wynonna Do (wwwb)?  When faced with a tough situation we all know that Jeremy asks himself “what would the Rock do?” Well, im- agine if Wynonna herself was leading the charge in the #FightForWynonna. What would our ass-kicking heroine do to save our show? How would SHE get IDW’s atten- tion?  Remember: Tag IDW and include the hashtags #FightForWynonna and #WynonnaEarp

Oliver and Felicity went through a little bit of a rough patch in their relationship earlier this season. How are they doing when we pick back up with them? Schwartz: They're definitely on track. They're back to, in a sense, being normal between each other. There's no friction between the relationship. They have a lot of obstacles in their way, but they'll be a team.

Gi  DAVID GREENE, HOST:  Anda lot of people have been paying Donald Trump a visit at Trump Tower in New York City, mostly people being considered for jobs in the new administration. But one meeting stands out. Navy Admiral Mike Rogers sat down with Trump. He is head of, the National Security Agency. He's in the military chain of command. And it appears he never told the current commander in chief he was doing this. Author and columnist James Bamford writes about the intelligence community and says it is hard to  underestimate the role Rogers plays.
1) The tweet failed to mention the federal rebates, which will exceed the carbon tax for Ontario residents. Could you please explain why.  2) The tweet also failed to mention climate change. Do you believe that the carbon tax will help fight climate change? If not, what climate policy do you believe would be more effective? Additionally, do you believe climate change is a problem that needs to be addressed by government policy?  3) Do you agree that that the carbon tax was implemented in Ontario after the government cancelled the cap and trade system?

Supreme Court Says Constitution Does Not Bar Partisan Gerrymandering  By Adam Liptak June 27, 2019  WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled against the challengers opposed to partisan gerrymandering, the practice in which the party that controls the state legislature draws voting maps to help elect its candidates.     The vote in two cases was 5 to 4, with the court’s more conservative members in the majority. The court appeared to close the door on such claims.  The drafters of the Constitution, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote for the majority, understood that politics would play a role in drawing election districts when they gave the task to state legislatures. Judges, the chief justice said, are not entitled to second-guess  lawmakers’ judgments.

Enjoyable evening. Free bar and nibbies. Highlights  ‘Some injuries due to new style of play. Obafemi doesn’t look after himself. Needs to be more professional.  ‘Some targets in mind for this window but they have to be for the jong term, Summer will see overhaul of squad to get us back to where we were ie Europe PEH on radar of elite clubs in Europe due to his development. That is the model we are reverting back towards. Buy cheap, develop into top players who end up at elite clubs.  Ralph H likes Slattery. Thinks he most advanced in his development. Likes Valery ‘but needs to improve heading. Obafemi another rough diamond.  Ralph K and Toby Steele reiterated about owner allowing all money made by club on transfers and operations to go back into playing squad. No money being taken out by Gao.  ‘South car park to become fan zone on match days subject to council approval, Maybe in Spring or start of next season.  Long term vision is to use old gas works site to be a fan village/zone. Council keen for site to benefit club rather than Sell to property developers. 3-5 years, away from happening.  Due diligence on Gao was done by external agency not club directly.  ‘Club actively exploring ways to move away fans as they acknowledge it gives: away team advantage by increased atmosphere for away team. All subject to police and council approval.  Rolph H says we are better defensively with 5 at back but not effective in attack  enough in defence, when defending plus no fire fighter in front of back 4 to protect them.  ‘On the whole positive outlook I think, Seems to be good synergy between both Ralph's but I guess he hasn't had a complete transfer window with club yet so time will teil,

Their love story turned Shadowhunters from a binge-worthy show into a viral sensation that makes even the most diehard fandoms seem like underachievers. The electric chemistry between Magnus (Harry S n Jr) and Alec (Matthe dario) is only the tip of the iceberg here; under the surface there's a deeply devoted, unbreakable connection between two people who should have been enemies but turned into soulmates. There's simply no ship on Freeform (or possibly on TV at all) that can hold a candle to Malec, and we'll ship them until the day we die. ll

Paul Bettencourt @senatetexas.gov For Immediate Release Contact Information Tuesday, Apa, 2018 Robert Flanagan | (713) 464-0282          Texas Senate Declares There Is an Emergency Crisis on the Southern Border SR 535, by Senator Bettencourt, calls upon the Federal Government to Act to solve this crisis  Austin — The Texas Senate today passed SR535, by Senator Bettencourt (R-Houston) to recognize that there is an urgent security and humanitarian crisis on the border between the United States and Mexico. Highlighting the urgency of the issue the Texas Senate voted to suspend nonmal rules and immediately debate the issue on the Senate Floor. This was done in response to recent statements from border officials highlighting that they are at a breaking point. SR535 was Joint-Authored by nineteen members of the Texas Senate. SR535 passed bya ‘vote of 19-12,     “There is a crisis on the border by every measurement that I understand,” said Senator Bettencourt. “It is, time to recognize the obvious. DHS has reported that there have been 100,000 interdictions at the border in just one month. It is time to declare this crisis the emergency that it is!”  Between 2011 and 2019 there have been 194,000 criminal illegal aliens booked in Texas jails. They have committed almost 300,000 crimes, including burglary, kidnapping, and various drug charges, over this same time period. Recent news reports also highlight the toll that human trafficking has taken with women who arrived in border towns reporting that they have been beaten, raped, and sometimes coerced into prostitution. On March 28, 2019. Kirstjen Nielsen (Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security), sent an urgent request to the United States Congress describing the border as "a inmanitarian and security catastrophe that is worsening by the day.”  ‘Senate Resolution 535 would resolve the following things: 1) Call upon the United States Congress to adopt a budget that fully funds all means necessary to fully  secure the Texas-Mexico intemational border, including deploying personnel and erecting barriers where needed.  2) Resolve that the ongoing crisis at the border is an “emergency” that must be addressed,  3) Support President Trump in his efforts to move forward with emergency action  “The failure of Washington, DC to do their job has created an undue burden on the backs of Texas taxpayers,” continued Senator Bettencourt. “Texans recognize that we have a crisis at the border and that speaking out is important. It is past time for us to speak out on this issue and it is past time for the Federal government to do their job and secure the border. Enough is enough!”  The Texas Senate, under the leadership of Lt. Governor Patrick (R-Houston) has allocated approximately $800 ‘million in the current biennium to support border enforcement along the Texas-Mexico border. at

It was a tremendous honor to get to collaborate with Ryan Coogler on Black Panther.

We've talked about that. It’s also how do you geta puck back? How do you forecheck? Do you forecheck with speed or with two feeton theice and let the guy break out?

zaterdag 22 december 2018 Wh) 35  TOT enteke ij Crystal  Bij Crystal Palace ligt zijn naam nu ook op tafel, Chelsea zoekt actief naar een oplossing voor Michy Batshuayi (25) en biedt de Rode Duivel overal aan, Achter zijn huur- periode bij Valencia wordt na dit weekend zo goed als zeker een punt gezet. Return to sender.  Meerdan een ‘marketingmatch is er nooit geweest. Na vierenhalve ‘maand laat Valencia, club met een, vleermuis in het emblem, ‘Bats- man’ alweer vliegen. Batshuayizit dit weekend, voor de thuismatch tegen Huesca, nog in de selectie, maar wordt daarna terug naar moederclub Chelsea gestuurd wegens niet gebracht wat ver- wacht, Wegens bekender van zijn geestige posts op sociale media dan van zijn prestaties. Ook op Mestalla heeft Batshuayi niet met die reputatie kunnen afrekenen. Deze uitleenbeurt is belangrijk voor mijn ontwikkelings, vertelde hij in oktober, «lk wil terugkeren naar Chelseaalseenbetere speler» fenties die hij niet waarmaakte. Valencia bleek Dortmund niet, waar hij begin dit jaar als hurling uit alle hoeken raak trapte, Zijn imago heeft bi Valenc je gekregen. Hij haalde de head- lines na zijn eerste van drie doe: punten, omdat hijzich in hetlijstje voegde van spelers die ooit in vier grote competities hebben ge scoord: Frankrijk, Engeland, Duits- land en Spanje. Een accolade die straks weer snel vergeten zal zijn Batshuayi speelde wel in 20van de 24 officiele wedstrijden, maar im poneerde zelden. Pendelen deed hij tussen bank en basis: 9 wed:                                 strijden gestart, 11 maal ingeval len, drie keer’ als ongebruikte bankzitter en een keer thuisgela ten Hetknetterde op een moment tussen de trainer en ziin spits, om: dat die zich zo moeilijk aanpaste. Zou Antonio Conte, ex-coach van Chelsea, dantoch gelik hebben ge hhad toen hij stelde dat iedereen de kwaliteiten van Batshuayi, buiten zijn neus voor goals, overschatte?  Nood aan stabiliteit Chelsea en Valencia hadden de voorbije dagen contact over ‘Bats- ‘man’. Omdathijeveneensniet inde plannen van Maurizio Sarri past, zoekt CEO Marina Granovskaiamee naar een oplossing Chelsea dat zijn marktwaarde keldert. De club hoopt dat hij na Niewwjaar elders wel kan knallen, Monaco,op voorspraak van coach Thierry Henry, AS Roma, AC Milan en ex club Marseille snuffelen allemaal rond. Chelsea bood Batshuayi ondertussen aan bij Crystal Palace, ‘op zoek naar een spits die naast de bijna herstelde Christian Benteke kan spelen. Palace overweegt de optie, maar wacht op een signal van de speler. Sinds zijn transfer naar Chelsea in de zomer van 2016, voor ruim 40 miljoen euro, verloopt zijn parcours hobbelig. ‘Batsman heeft nood aan stabiliteit                      VIER CLUBS IN VIER JAAR     Marseile fn14 jun. 6 Chelsea un. 16 jan.

Clinton investigation after the President had already decided to fire Comey. The President's draft termination letter also stated that morale in the FBI was at an all-time low and Sanders told the press after Comey’s termination that the White House had heard from “countless” FBI agents who had lost confidence in Comey. But the evidence does not support those claims. The President told Comey at their January 27 dinner that “the people of the FBI really like [him],” no evidence suggests that the President heard otherwise before deciding to terminate Comey, and Sanders acknowledged to investigators that her comments were not founded on anything.

As such, the Mueller Report does not reach legal conclusions, and this chart is based on personal interpretations of the strength of the evidence presented. It is presented for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice.  2 An “Obstructive Act” is an action that prevents justice from being administered, and can refer to anything that blocks, makes difficult, or hinders such administration.  3 “Nexus” requires a formal proceeding, the obstructive action being likely to impede it, and an actor that knows or has reason to know of the proceeding and acted with a likelihood of impeding that proceeding.  * Corrupt Intent requires a showing that the actor took such action with an intent to obtain an improper advantage inconsistent with their duties.  5 A charge can only result from the presence of all three elements (act, nexus, intent).  ® At least one other pending case is discussed in the report with full redaction.

“The red MAGA hat  is the new white hood.”  - Alyssa Milano

To say the parents deserve no blame for the R Kelly situation is like saying the dope man is not to blame when someone dies froma drug overdose. Most addicts need a supplier to feed their unhealthy habit. All parties have some accountability.

In addition to fluent use of tidyverse/ggplot2, candidates should have experience with ANOVAs as well as other linear models and other regression ‘techniques (e.g., SEM, MLM, etc), training in longitudinal analyses, and some familiarity with R Markdown and version control software (e.g., Git). The position is 50% data scienbe on ongoing team ‘work (including cleaning and analyzing data, helping lab mates on R projects, etc) and 50% original research on topics of mutual interest.  While not required, some additional indicators that this position could be a good fit would be an applicant's interest in diversity science, open science, an interest in informally teaching quantitative skills to others, and experience with RedCap.  This position would be a great fit for a student with a psychology background who is interested in continuing in academia or is interested in moving into statistical consulting, data science, or industry.

We say cejew of else were Coming foc ye: ose
Unfortunately, despite all of the amazing efforts of the Timeless fandom, Sony Pictures Television has informed us that “it is unlikely [they] will get the series picked up again.” Movies or specials may be a possibility down the road, but this will likely not happen in the near future. SPTV has also advised us that it is not prudent for us to plan any further major, cost-intensive Save Timeless projects, as we have been told that such grand gestures would not have an effect on a season 3 pick up.  We are extremely disappointed in this news, but we are also very proud of everything this fandom has accomplished together. We will continue to spread our love of timeless through the current re-watch schedule, after which we will be scaling back on daily campaign activities. We have informed SPTV that the HQ account will remain open, and that the Timeless fandom will always be here, ready to make noise, if the need arises.  To celebrate all that we have accomplished together, we have been doing research ona Timeless Legacy project that would help fund historical sites and organizations inspired by our love of the show. Examples include sponsoring dedication plaques or bricks at Timeless-related historical sites or museums. This will be a chance for us to come together and not only leave our mark, but also have a positive impact on the world in the name of Timeless. If you are interested in helping with this endeavor, or have further questions, please DM us and we will be happy to address it privately.

Joint Schumer-Pelosi Statement On Attorney General Barr's Summary Of The Mueller Report  Washington, D.C. - Today, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi released the following statement regarding Attorney General Barr’s summary of the Mueller report.  “attorney General Barr's letter raises as many questions as it answers. The fact that Special Counsel Mueller’s report does not exonerate the president on a charge as serious as obstruction of justice demonstrates how urgent it is that the full report and underlying documentation be made public without any further delay. Given Mr. Bart’s public record of bias against the Special Counsel's inquiry, he is not a neutral observer and is not in a position to make objective determinations about the report.  “And most obviously, for the president to say he is completely exonerated directly contradicts the words of Mr. Mueller and is not to be taken with any degree of credibility.  “Congress requires the full report and the underlying documents so that the Committees can proceed with their independent work, including oversight and legislating to address any issues the Mueller report may raise. The American people have a right to know”  HHH

NWSL PLAYERS  association  We'd like to thank all who played a part in making our first annual NWSLPA auction a huge success! Thank you to Shop La Cle for the ongoing fundraising support through the creation of  our United We Are Stronger Refocus bands. And thank you to our own Tori Huster for organizing and managing the auction. With enormous gratitude to all those who helped to spread the word and those who bid on bands, we are proud to announce that we raised over $11,000! These funds will go directly to supporting the mission of the NWSLPA through covering legal and accounting expenses, a travel budget for a representative to be present at important events, and the work necessary to add value to the current player experience. Thank you again to all and we are very excited to kick off our SEVENTH NWSL season very soon!

We have heard from some readers upset with our publishing a photo showing victims after a brutal attack in Nairobi.  We understand how painful this coverage can be, and we try to be very sensitive in how we handle both words and images in these situations.  We want to be respectful to the victims and to others affected by the attack.  But we also believe it is important to give our readers  a clear picture of the horror of an attack like this. This  includes showing pictures that are not sensationalized but that give a real sense of the situation.  We take the same approach wherever in the world something like this happens -- balancing the need for sensitivity and respect with our mission of showing the reality of these events.

<                  FT Weekend  While Britain’s impending exit from the EU has caused uncertainty for the Sunderland plant, which exports roughly half its cars, the decline of diesel across the continent was a more significant factor, according to  people familiar with the company’s thinking.  The X-Trail is a large sport utility vehicle, the biggest passenger vehicle  made by the Japanese group, and it had planned to make diesel models in the UK.  However, the company struggled to make the new diesel cars compliant with the latest emission rules using diesel engines that it buys from Renault, according to one person, and fears of an accelerating decline of  the fuel source among the public coloured its decision.  Nissan has already pledged to eliminate diesel from its line-up, saying it would not launch another new diesel car after 2021, one of several manufacturers including Toyota, Volvo and Fiat Chrysler planning to  phase out the technology.  To make petrol versions of the X-Trail in the UK would require shipping

In “The Flower,” you sing about “being the flower to your pain.” What led you to write that?  “Flowers have been very significant throughout my life. From sad and painful experiences and moments of loss, to joy and celebration. Specifically, I wrote this song because I wanted to comfort others who are struggling or need help. And the specific memory that inspired the song was that I remember putting a flower on my mom’s coffin at her funeral. I know it’s a little heavy. I wanted to write an uplifting song, but one that acknowledges both sides of the beauty and pain in a flower, or what the flower represents. That definitely is a special song for me.”

| got your question about AG's testifying. _ It's not as straight forward as one would hope, but we were able to search minutes of committee hearings from 1931 — 2001, and only found a couple. We went on the assumption that the AG would be identified by both his name and title, which is not necessarily, airtight, but only found a couple of instances where the Attorney General was testifying before a special investigative committee, and not regular bills over the course of a session.  We do have access to witness lists going back to 2001, that can be searched by name. | looked briefly for John Comyn, Greg Abbott and Ken Paxton, and did find a couple of times when each were listed for bls (other than the appropriations bills). These are tedious to verify, since, even if the name is listed, it is not clear if they actually testified, or sent someone from the office. To verify the actual testimony you have to actually watch the hearing. For example, Greg Abbott appears to have testified himself for two bill in the 80th (2007). They were HB 8 and SB 5 from that year!  So, bottom line, we found a couple of instances, but cannot do a complete search. witness lists have only searchable for the last 20 years or so.  Sorry for the muddy response.  Sally H

‘The key information here is the Acting Associate Attorney General has a 210 day legal “lifespan”.  A quick google search and here is the original article: In this article, we learn the following:  However, because Panuccio is not Senate-confirmed, he would not act as attomney general (or deputy attorney general) if those offices  were also to become vacant. Instead, under the Justice Department's  uuccession statute and guidelines implementing that law issued by Attorney General Loretta Lynch in November 2016, Brand is replaced in that line of succession by Solicitor General Noel Francisco (the solicitor general is the nation’s chief legal  representative in front of the Supreme Court).  Jamsry 207037 May 387017 feb202018 —_exptay 342018 From the table, we see that as of May 24 2018, Jess Panuccio will have spent an aggregated 210 days as Acting Associate Attorney General. This answers to Q’s question: "‘acting' When does the clock run out?" This means that after this date, Jess Panuccio will no longer be eligible to that acting position and will therefore get out of the line of succession to replace Rosenstein. His spot made vacant, which is the #3 in the DOJ, can then be filled by Trump according to Q’s quote in Q1433:  So you now understand why Q asked: “who is Rachel Brand? Why was Rachel Brand dismissed? Think timing”. The answer is: she was the Senate confirmed Associate Attorney General “inserted” in the process to “extend” Panuccio’s legal lifespan as Acting Associate Attorney General so that his legal “expiration date” can coincide with Rosenstein’s firing! Now this is slick!  P a, wn “Read again...  You see it? When Rosenstein is out, Panuccio cannot replace him and the rule to be applied will be here:  Therefore Solicitor General Noel Francisco would replace Rosenstein. And who appointed Francisco? Trump! That’s our guy!  So at the end of this mechanical succession process, Trump and Sessions will have their guy in #2 and get to pick who to put in #3. All this without needing any Senate

(3)  o VAN TRUMP  Report  I'm staying extremely bullish, even on the breaks.  The USDA most recently cut their new-crop production estimate from 15.030 billion bushels down to 13.680 billion bushels. At the same time they are still forecasting 82.4 million corn acres will be harvested. I personally say, no way that happens! I'm not faulting the USDA, | fully understand they need some additional time to gather more accurate data, and this was just an early guess on their part. But | certainly don't believe the market has fully accounted for all of the damage. | realistically believe U.S. harvested acres could ultimately be -5 million to -10 million less than the current USDA estimate, meaning somewhere between 72.4 and 77.4 million. For argument sake, let's assume the USDA is close with their current 166 bushel per acre average yield estimate. If I'm right about harvested acres, that puts total production somewhere between 12.0 and 12.8 billion bushels. And, | actually think the "average yield" estimate could also be heavily debated. Especially when you consider the yield drag that will be seen in Illinois, who led the nation last year with an average of 196.6 bushels per acre. We also have Indian, Ohio, and South Dakota who traditionally produce strong yields, now seeing massive problems. Interestingly, there are several research studies circulating inside the trade that argue in years with the slowest corn planting progress i.e. 1983, 1993 and 1995, the overall yield-drag was at least -10% below trend. There's many that now argue that conditions this year have been so bad in key growing regions that the average yield drag could be closer to -20%. In other words, perhaps we will be looking at an average yield of somewhere in the 140 to 160 range.

"the first person who breaks your heart will teach you three things. 1. life goes on. even when you think it won't, life finds a way to go on. so you will go on. you will move on and you will learn how to appreciate love and life again. it's just a matter of time. 2. people come and go. that's the nature of it. the exchange of it. you take what you learn from them and apply it to the next person who finds you. you understand what you went through a little more and you never forget the way they made you feel. and 3. you realize what's real. what truly matters once they're gone. you realize what's worth fighting for and what isn't. and above all, you realize what you once thought was the end was really just another beginning. you take all the pain and make something beautiful from it—of it. you take all your broken pieces and let go of everything that weighs you down.”  —r.m. drake

Sarah Kendzior, a journalist and an expert scholar on authoritarian states, talks to Joy-Ann Reid and warns: America is not immune to kleptocracy and authoritharian rule.     "| think it's important that Americans realize this can happen here, that this is something that has happened in countries all over the world and we are not immune. Trump has laid out his intentions very clearly throughout his campaign. His slogan might have been ‘America First’ — which of course is a throw back to fascism — but it's really ‘America Last’ And who comes first is Trump and his family. All the incidences you just described of installing his family within the Administration, not divorcing his business interest from the government, not disclosing his tax  returns — those are all signs of kleptocracy. Kleptocracy often goes hand-in-hand with authoritarian rule. You see this in particular in Russia and in other post-Soviet authoritarian states in which the person in power can abuse executive laws, can often rewrite laws, in order to keep that financial benefit flowing. And so we are much more vulnerable than we think. Our systems of checks and balances, of legal procedures may not hold when somebody whose primary goal is to personally benefit himself by stripping down the state to its parts is in charge and is able to override some of those regulations."

FROM POLITICS  1. Don’t say you’re doing it to spend time with family. Not even your family believes that one. 2. Don’t say you’re doing it for a health reason. Unless you’re prepared to share x-rays, no one believes that, either.  3. Don’t say you’re resigning because you’ve become a distraction, because resigning in the middle of a scandal IS the distraction.  4. Don’t say it’s because of the environment or something like that. Until recently, you went to meetings on jets.  5. Don’t say you didn’t do anything wrong, because that immediately suggests to everyone that you did.

Gov. Edwards said: (  “In 2015, I ran for govermor as a pro-life candidate after serving as a pro-life legislator for eight years. As governor, I have been true to my word and my beliefs on this issue. But it is also my sincere belief that being pro-life means more than just being pro-birth.  My first act as governor was to expand access to health care for working Louisianans. I have worked with Republicans and Democrats in the Legislature to expand investment in education and pass sweeping criminal justice reforms. For each of the last three years. my administration has set records for the number of children being adopted out of our foster care system. And despite fierce opposition, I’ve fought to ensure LGBT citizens are not discriminated against in the workplace. to raise the minimum wage, and to pay a woman the same as a man for doing the same job.  I know there are many who feel just as strongly as I do on abortion and disagree with me — and I respect their opinions. As I prepare to sign this bill, I call on the overwhelming bipartisan majority of legislators who voted for it to join me in continuing to build a better Louisiana that cares for the least among us and provides more opportunity for everyone.”

Queen of diamonds  Melanie Phillips  Daily Mail columnist                 ‘A Daily ait columns Melanie Philips Photograph: The Guardian  Mel P (Genuinely Scary Spice) appears to believe that half the scientists on earth are engaged in a series of giant conspiracies. Like Christopher Booker (below), she dismisses not only climate change but also the entire canon of evolutionary science. She also stoutly defends the thesis that MMR injections cause autism.  She claims that "the theory that global warming is all the fault of mankind is a massive scam based on flawed computer modelling, bad science and an anti-western ideology ... The majority of well-meaning opinion in the ‘Western world believes a pack of lies and propaganda". She has also maintained that "carbon dioxide forms a  relatively small proportion of the atmosphere, most of which consists of  water vapour.”  If this were the case, we would need gills.

As President | cannot make decisions on foreign policy in a  feudal effort to appease partisan critics or the Media or Democrats that want to do nothing more than resist and obstruct.  Constructive dialogue between the United States and Russia forwards the opportunity to open new pathways toward peace and stability in our world. | would rather take a political risk the pursuit of peace, than to risk peace in pursuit of politics.  As President;-| will always put what is best for America and what is best for the American people.”  President Donald J. Trump  ea CmsLeliil om alin) clare WACK Es}

——  Actions Against Venezuela's Corrupt Regime     Press Statement Michael R. Pompeo Secretary of State Washington, DC January 10, 2019  The United States condemns Maduro’s illegitimate usurpation of power today following the unfree and unfair elections he imposed on the Venezuelan people on May 20, 2018. The United States remains steadfast in its support of the Venezuelan people and will continue to use the full weight of U.S. economic and diplomatic power to press for the restoration of Venezuelan democracy.  Today, we reiterate our support for Venezuela's National Assembly, the only legitimate branch of government duly elected by the Venezuelan people. It is time for Venezuela to begin a transitional process that can restore the constitutional, democratic order by holding free and fair elections that respect the will of the Venezuelan people.  To advance this goal, the United States has taken aggressive action against the Maduro regime and its enablers. Most recently, on January 8, the United States imposed sanctions on seven individuals and 23 entities involved in a corruption scheme to exploit Venezuela's currency exchange practices. By rigging the system in their favor, these individuals and entities stole more than $2.4 billion ‘as the Venezuelan people starved. We applaud the initiative by the new National Assembly leadership to work with the international community to recover these and other stolen funds and to use them to relieve the suffering of Venezuela's people. The United States will continue to play an active role towards this end.  We also have implemented and will continue to impose visa revocations and other restrictions for current and former Venezuelan government officials and their family members believed to be responsible for or complicit in human rights abuses, acts of public corruption, and the undermining of democratic governance. We will not allow them to act without consequence or enjoy their ill-gotten gains in the United States — and urge other countries to act likewise  Itis time for Venezuelan leaders to make a choice. We urge those who support this regime, from every day employees getting by on food subsidies to the Venezuelan security forces sworn to support the constitution, to stop enabling repression and corruption and to work with the National Assembly and its duly elected leader, Juan Guaido, in accordance with your constitution on a peaceful return to democracy. The Venezuelan people and the international community will remember and judge your actions. Nowis the time to convince the Maduro dictatorship that the moment has arrived for democracy to return to Venezuela.

Rubin, PhD: An Ambassador for Behavioral Science  in Diabetes  Diabetes Care 2017;40;435-439 | DOI: 10.2337/dc16-1764  Richard Roy Rubin, PhD, (“Dick” to many of his friends) was born in Lima, Peru, to Goldie (Possoff) and Morton Rubin. Goldie attended Temple University, while Morton attended Penn State and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he specialized in southern hemisphere weather. Morton's job of forecasting weather for Pan American- Grace Airways (Panagra) afforded the young couple the opportunity to relo- cate several times in their early years. They were living in Uma when Richard was born in 1943 and in Santiago, Chile,  in the hospital with a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Richard remembered it as a devastating blow to the family (Mary Sue was the first in her extended family to be diagnosed with the disease (1]). Mary Sue's diagnosis, and later Richard’s ‘own son's diagnosis, would be reason enough to turn his career path to the field of diabetes. in 1961, Richard moved to Baltimore to attend Johns Hopkins University (JHU).  Initially, his career path did not in- volve diabetes. He received his BA in his- tory with honors, was inducted into Phi  Mork Peyrot     Richord R. Rubin

After Flynn withdrew from a joint defense agreement with the President and began cooperating with the government, the President’s personal counsel left a message for Flynn’s attorneys reminding them of the President’s warm feelings towards Flynn, which he said “still remains,” and asking for a “heads up” if Flynn knew “information that implicates the President.” When Flynn’s counsel reiterated that Flynn could no longer share information pursuant to a joint defense agreement, the President’s personal counsel said he would make sure that the President knew that Flynn’s actions reflected “hostility” towards the President.

In not “Not Barbie,” what do you mean by “flipping through these magazines, page after page, and nobody looks like me?”  “When I was growing up, I wanted to see more women who looked like me, and hopefully I can live up to being somebody that can inspire other little Asian girls. Because I believe that change starts with you. That’s what I felt when I wrote that.  “Also that song is written from my experiences from the pressures of being perfect, which stem from my K-pop background. All these pressures to modify yourself to whatever you're told to or is [trendy] takes such a huge emotional toll. This song is a positive way of talking about my journey of getting lost in that. Because we are now at a time where what makes you different is beautiful. Mental and emotional health and awareness definitely plays a role in this song.”

Has the reporter seen the evidence? That’s key, especially when the story relies on unnamed sources,  4, Terms like “process crime” and “perjury trap” are used to discount serious indictments,  . Wait for a bombshell to be corroborated, not just quoted, by multiple outlets,  . Ignore rumors of the Mueller report's imminent release and its contents, The public might never see Mueller’s complete findings.  . The press may confuse Mueller’s whole report with the summary he must deliver to Congress (and on to us).  . The Mueller probe is no deus ex machina, It’s not his job to uncover it all.

Coming back to Old Trafford and to having a standing ovation is not easy to digest... thank you to all the Manchester United fans today for doing that. A day | will never forget. Hopefully United can get back winning premier leagues and champions leagues soon for the deserving fans, players and staff. Once again thank you very much and good luck in the future! Love you all!

lan Tulloch eee January 25, 2017 -@vw  Most people don't know this, but I've been suffering from depression for the past 2+ years. I've been doing amazing lately, but I'd be lying if | said there weren't some really dark times over the past year or two. Thinking that depression (or mental illness of any kind) is a form of weakness or somehow YOUR fault results in a viscous cycle, making that uphill battle even more difficult for you every day.  More importantly, this way of thinking is just objectively untrue. When you get caught in this cycle, your brain chemistry is altered. Anyone who thinks you need to just "snap out of it" needs to realize that it's not much different from a chronic illness. Unfortunately it's not that easy. You need support in more ways than one.  Let's do our best to end the stigma & not feel afraid to reach out to friends, family, or professionals when we need some help. It's amazing how far just talking about it can go. No one should be in this fight alone. Let's talk about mental health. #BellLetsTalk  oo Stacey Semkiw, Lodovica Vinci and 117 others 8 Comments 1 Share  a Like © Comment (@ Share

which is, of course, Jackson’s catalog and his reputation. Think about it for a second: The justice $btem, the courts... is that not where you go to get justice when you have been wronged? Is that not the proper way to seek redress? If someone stabs you in the street, you don’t write a novel about it.

SUMMARY Played in 39 games, but only 16 as the full time starter. Had a very good season his senior year for Nebraska averaging 7 yards per rush and amassing over 1,000 yards. Has good size for the position, and believed to play larger (230) than his listed size at pro day. Compact torso and long leg build with strength underneath to sustain and power through on tough runs. Is a good athlete with nice burst when attacking the running lane. More quick than fast, but explosive burst allows him to capture the edge and reach the second level. Stays under control and patient from the mesh points to the line of scrimmage showing a knack for allowing blocking to develop in front of him (between the tackles). Nice cut ability with good short area quickness. Has the ability to stop/start and change direction based on the flow of defenders. Lowers his center of gravity prior to contact to create leverage and move his momentum forward. Maintains balance through contact and has smooth footwork to stay grounded, Preferred method contact is, {to lower shoulder and power through and is more of a heavy finisher than he is elusive, but will grind forward in piles constantly working his feet. Very good understanding of his location on the field and is quick to head north to prevent tackle for loss situations. A willing blocker that still needs to refine technique. Good mental processing to read defense pre-snap and note potential blitzers/rushers in [blocking assignments. Saw limited touches as a receiver, but was effective when asked to fill the role. Lined up in the backfield, in the slot and out wide on occasion. Route tree is simplistic (wheel /in/out/flat), but there's definitely something to build on here. Long strides, size and powerful running style can make him dangerous in the open field for smaller defensive backs. Is impatient when it comes to his outside runs/pulls and will cut up field before allowing blocks to develop, Would stutter step too much out wide and didn't seem to have the same understanding/drive as he did when attacking inside. A “see it and go” runner who doesn't seem to have full field vision right now. Can be seen running loose with the football and has to be consistent with holding it high and tight to prevent fumbles. “Catches” defenders in passing lanes instead of creating an anchor and shooting hands to extend and lock out oncoming rushers. Inconsistent as a receiver with his hands. At times would extend to go get the football and other times would miss routine plays. Could be attributed to lack of experience in this area. Unique prospect who has limited tread on the tires as he only saw 284 rushing attempts over his junior and senior seasons. Likely a NFL backup as he still needs to improve on his pass blocking, become more consistent as a receiver and be more patient attacking the outside, but is a great fit in a committee system who can contribute early in his career.

caradelevingne & Gentleman? @haileybieber @justinbieber you must be bored. | wish you spent less time sticking up for men and more time trying to understand women and respecting their valid reactions. As a married man, you should be lifting women up instead of tearing them down because you are threatened. | am not sure you actually understand what an apology is. This issue that @taylorswift is talking out is about far more than a picture and you know that. As you said, you haven't spoken to her in years which means you definitely don’t understand the situation. | do. Take a step back and try and learn from this. We should all be on the same team.

Office of the Press Secretary     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE. January 31, 2019  Statement of the United States Regarding China Talks  For the last two days, high-ranking officials from the United States and China have engaged in intense and productive negotiations over the economic relationship between our two countries. The United States appreciates the preparation, diligence, and professionalism shown throughout these meetings by Vice Premier Liu He and his team.  ‘The talks covered a wide range of issues, including: (2) the ways in which United States companies are pressured to transfer technology to Chinese companies; (2) the need for stronger protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights in China; (3) the numerous tariff and non-tariff barriers faced by United States companies in China; (4) the harm resulting from China's cyber-theft of United States commercial property; (5) how market-distorting forces, including subsidies and state-owned enterprises, can lead to excess capacity; (6) the need to remove market barriers and tariffs that limit United States sales of manufactured goods, services, and agriculture to China; and (7) the role of currencies in the United States~China trading relationship. The two sides also discussed the need to reduce the enormous and growing trade deficit that the United States has with China. The purchase of United States products by China from our farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and businesses is a critical part of the negotiations.  ‘The two sides showed a helpful willingness to engage on all major issues, and the negotiating sessions featured productive and technical discussions on how to resolve our differences. The United States is particularly focused on reaching meaningful commitments on structural issues and deficit reduction. Both parties have agreed that any resolution will be fully enforceable.  While progress has been made, much work remains to be done. President Donald J. Trump has reiterated that the 90-day process agreed to in Buenos Aires represents a hard deadline, and that United States tariffs will increase unless the United States and China  reach a satisfactory outcome by March 1, 2019. The United States looks forward to further talks with China on these vital topics.  eee

_ a  BREAKING NEWS
Obstruction of Justice. The report’s second part addresses a number of actions by the President — most of which have been the subject of public reporting — that the Special Counsel investigated as potentially raising obstruction-of-justice concerns. After making a “thorough factual investigation” into these matters, the Special Counsel considered whether to evaluate the conduct under Department standards governing prosecution and declination decisions but ultimately determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment. The Special Counsel therefore did not draw a conclusion — one way or the other — as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction. Instead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the Special Counsel views as “difficult issues” of law and fact concerning whether the President’s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction. The Special Counsel states that “while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”

Ganbay II ‘Yuma Public Affairs Office (928) 314-6239 seww.cbp.gov  News Release  Yuma Sector Arrests Two MS-13 Gang Members from Honduras  YUMA, Ariz. — Yuma Sector Border Patrol agents apprehended two MS-13 gang members from Honduras after they made an illegal entry into the United States together Tuesday evening.  At approximately 6:00 p.m., agents patrolling along the Colorado River apprehended a 37-year-old man and 19-year-old man, both from Honduras, after they illegally entered the U.S. near County 9* Street. They were transported to the Yuma Border Patrol Station for processing.  During processing, agents identified both men as MS-13 gang members. The 37-year-old man was also discovered to have previous criminal convictions for shoplifting and providing false information in Gwinnett County, Georgia as well as a previous deportation. The 19-year-old man did not have any previous criminal or immigration histories in the U.S.  Both subjects are being presented for prosecution and deportation.  All persons apprehended by the Border Patrol undergo criminal history checks using biometrics to ensure illegal immigrants with criminal histories are positively identified.  USS. Customs and Border Protection officials welcome assistance from the community. Individuals can report suspicious activity to the Border Patrol and remain anonymous by calling 1-877-872-7435 toll free. Reporting illicit activity could result in saving someone's life.  -CBP-  U.S. Customs and Border Protection is the unified border agency within the Department of Homeland  Security charged with management, control and protection of our nation’s borders at and between official  ports of entry. CBP’s mission includes keeping terrorist: and terrorist weapons out of the county while enforcing hundreds of US. laws. Follow us on Twitter @CBPAnzona

ve @elizabethwarren’ » —————— for signing the Equality  Act petition !!     This note is~AMAZING-  It's 2019 and our LGBTQ+ friends continue to face discrimination at work, school, and in their communities. Trans pedple tn America are getting murdered — most of them women of color. In the name of protecting religious liberty, civil rights are being trampled on. It's hard to find an affordable place to live that doesn't discriminate based on your gender identity or expression, race, or who you love.  Enough is enough. I'm proud to represent Massachusetts in the Senate, a state that has led the nation in protecting and promoting equality. But there's so much more work to be done. We can start by passing the Equality Act — a bill that would protect LGBTQ people from discrimination in their places of work,  homes, schools, and other public accommodations     I'm glad to see the United States House of Representatives has taken the first  s in the fight for equality by passing this crucial legislation to ban discrimination, protect transgender rights, and resist the Trump administration's efforts to roll back our progress. Now it's on my colleagues in the Senate to be on the right side of history, prove they represent all of their constituents, and provide equal rights and protection to every American.      LGBTQ rights are civil rights. LGBTQ activists have never given up, they've  organized, and brought about transformational change. But the work is far from  over. Thank you Taylor Swift for being in this fight to pass the Equality Act.  Thanks to all of you who have signed this petition and are fighting for change in  your communities - we know that we have the power of your voices on our side. , We will keep fighting until everyone can live proudly, without fear.

BEYONCE     Today we're pleased to honor Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex. Meghan's background as a film and tv actress has allowed her to use her platform for good. Meghan's charitable work in communities of color began years before becoming the Duchess of Sussex. As a global ambassador for World Vision, she traveled to Rwanda to see how access to clean, safe water impacts children, an issue that is near and dear to our hearts. She also visited and supported the Myna Mahila Foundation in Mumbai, an organization that helps solve the menstruation challenges many women and girls in the community face.  She became the Duchess of Sussex following her marriage to Prince Harry of the British royal family in May 2018, becoming one of the few Black women to join a royal family. Meghan brought many Black traditions to her Royal Wedding including a Chicago-based Black pastor, an amazing gospel choir, and a young Black cellist. At the wedding her culture was front and center, and she and Prince Harry have continued to push the race relations dialogue forward both near and far.  In honor of Black History Month, we bow down to one of our Melanated Monas. Congrats on your pregnancy! We wish you so much joy.

San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.  The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime -- one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our Nation's most dangerous cities. Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities.  Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.  As we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.

es  repmcgovern *& A few weeks ago, as we were going through the list of things we needed for our first meeting of the Rules Committee, we realized we didn’t have a gavel. Well, when my family found out, they decided to surprise me with a very special one.  My dad Walter owns a package store in Worcester. And years ago, when he was the president of the Worcester County Package Store Association, he was given a ceremonial gavel to use. So last week he brought it with him to Washington — and gave it to me on swearing-in day to use during our Rules Committee meetings.

MUSIC REVIEWS.  Bassoon Sonata by lan Stephens pub. Composers’ Edition  Commissioned by Miranda Dodd for her husband Matthew's 50th birthday, this is a 15-minute piece which was premiered at Pigotts Music Camp by Matthew Dodd and Sam Laughton on 4th August 2018. In the preface lan gives a full description of all the movements.  ‘Ode’, the first movement, starts with a lyrical solo bassoon passage which is very satisfying to play and full of rhythmic interest. Indeed the whole piece is rhythmically challenging and the piano part equally so. As a fairly competent pianist | was able to have a good stab at it with a couple of students at the Royal Academy of Music where it went down well. After a fast energetic section, the 1st movement ends with another lyrical section.  Given its title, the second movement ‘Wild Dance’ needs little additional explanation. After a short, lyrical middle section, it leads to some further very rhythmical material with continually changing time signatures.  ‘Song Without Words’, marked tranquillo, is exactly that although the bassoon part is hardly static with lots of running semiquavers at times. The piano part is equally busy. ‘Scat’ is a fast and furious bebop movement, which is. over all too quickly but great fun to play.  This is undoubtably a highly accomplished composition, very well written for both bassoon and piano. For me, all the rhythmic ideas make it a fascinating work which is both challenging and satisfying. It contains everything required to show off the bassoon at its best — lyrical and technical - and uses the full range from bottom Bb to top E. As an audience piece it should be great to listen to, and could certainly be used for recital purposes including final recitals at music colleges.  I can seriously recommend its addition to our repertoire, but definitely not for the faint hearted. I’m really looking forward to working on it with my students and hearing it in one or more of their recitals.  John Orford  [Ed. John Orford has chosen lan Stephens’ Bassoon Sonata as the set work for the 2019 Florence Woodbridge Prize at the Royal Academy of Music. The competition will take  place on Friday 5 July at 10.00am, in the Henry Wood Room.]

THE NUMBER SYSTEM:  Everyone needs a "go to". Below is a number system that I use with my loved one who suffers from depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation.  Checking on someone's mental health can be as easy as simply texting a number. If someone you know is in crisis, send them a text       Give me a number  Many folks in a depressive episode find it very difficult to talk. Asking them to “give you a number" allows them to reach out using only one digit.  On a scale from one to ten - one being the worst and ten being the highest - you can evaluate their emotional needs and safety in that very moment without stressing their already overloaded system  ONE NUMBER.

Senate Committee Advances Health Reform Package  By MAL LEARY « 41 MINUTES AGO  Qsr2¢ Qe Q evar  The U.S. Senate is considering a sweeping health care reform bill that includes  provisions authored by Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins.  “A far reaching bill that | believe is going to make a real difference in providing more  transparency, accountability and lower health care costs,” says Collins.  The bill, approved by the Senate Health Committee, includes directives aimed at preventing surprise medical bills, reducing prescription drug prices, and investing in  public health. The measure now goes to the full Senate where it could be amended.  “We heard repeatedly how critical primary care is to getting a handle on health care costs” says Collins. “By the year 2030, our country is projected to need 120,000 physicians”

STATEMENT FROM ATHLETICS DIRECTOR TOM BURMAN ON THE RETIREMENT OF COWGIRL BASKETBALL COACH JOE LEGERSKI  Trespect Joe as much as anyone who I have worked with in college athletics. I will miss him more than I can say, but I have to respect his decision to retire from the head-coaching position here at the University of Wyoming.     T can't thank Joe enough for everything he has done in building Cowgirl Basketball into the outstanding program it is, from successes too numerous to name on the court to the many successes his players have achieved off the court.  He is a great colleague and friend. He has always been a team player for our athletics department, and he has been a great  mentor to so many young women who played for him and so many coaches who worked with him. We will miss him being on  the sidelines and I know Cowgirl fans will miss him, but we look forward to him continuing to be a part of our program as a Wyoming alum and a Wyoming fan.  Cowgirl Basketball is a program that is extremely important to our state and our athletics department. We will explore all  ___ Options available to us to find a new head coach who understands the importance of this program to our state and whois  dedicated to continuing the success that Cowgirl Basketball has enjoyed under Coach Legerski.

1. Apologize to children when you are wrong.  2.Do not assume you're smarter than achild simply because you're older.  3. Say thank you to children when they do something for you or others.  4. Admit when you've made a mistake

some days. You think about these guys, the ‘85 team, the ‘16 team, the ‘13 team, there are just so many moments that you think back on when you're just not having that good day. That’s what you play for. If | talked to Burke Masters right now, what would he say? He would love to be out there today. He would love to be out there in a 20-degree game in the snow. He would love to go back out there and wear this [uniform] one more time. So, that’s what you think about. You think about the tradition here, the guys that would give anything to come back for one more day, and that’s what | think about. This is my last year and the guys that might not play at the next level think about that, this is all we have for right now. You think back about what we’ve had here and all of the guys that would give anything to go out there and play one more game, relive one more moment. That’s what you have to think about.

Palmer's New Year 'Advertising Blitz' fails to attract voters - United Australia Party at 1%  Market Research Update - Page Online : 13 February 2019 Original article by Roy Morgan  Roy Morgan Summary  Clive Palmer has been ubiquitous on Australian screens - whether TV, mobile, tablet, or computer over the last few weeks, but the latest Roy Morgan Poll conducted with 1,673 electors over the last fortnight shows that Palmer's 2019 advertising blitz has failed to convince Australians to give the former Fairfax MP another chance in Federal politics. Palmer's newly rebranded United Australia Party (UAP) is attracting only 1% of the vote and trails fellow Queensland based party One Nation on 3% support. In total 29.5% of Australians are supporting minor parties and independents, but this figure is dominated by the Greens (12.5%) and Independents/Others (11.5%). The remaining 5.5% is spread between One Nation, UAP, Katter's Australian Party, Australian Conservatives and the Christian Democratic Party. The ALP (36%) leads the L-NP (34.5%) on primary votes and the ALP enjoys a comfortable two-party preferred lead over the L-NP on the back of Greens preferences. Greens preferences traditionally flow to the ALP on a ratio of 80% cf. 20%. Roy Morgan has in-depth demographic and voting data for all 151 Australian electorates as Australians head toward a Federal Election due in three months' time. [full text]

When is the next federal election?  As House of Representatives and half-Senate elections are usually held simultaneously, the earliest date for such an election would be Saturday 4 August 2018.  As the latest possible date for a half-Senate election is Saturday 18 May 2019, the latest possible date for a simultaneous (half-Senate and House of Representatives) election is also Saturday 18 May 2019.

Modernizing and streamlining the role of public health units across the province will better coordinate access to health promotion and disease prevention programs at the local level, ensuring that Ontario's families stay safe and healthy. Ultimately, the government's proposed plan will enable a better matching of public health needs with local realities.  As we modernize public health in Ontario, public health units that don’t benefit from the population size or annual budget that would help effectively respond to this year's shift in the cost-sharing funding model will be protected from major cost increases. This would include almost all of the public health units that service LUMCO municipalities, as well as those that support rural and northern communities.  Our government has every expectation that public health units will continue to be properly funded as we empower municipalities to have a stronger role in the delivery of public health  We value the feedback and relationship we have with our municipal partners. That's why we have a monthly meeting with AMO where we discuss items like public health transformation. LUMCO has a seat at this table and has been part of these discussions. Additionally, we are working to confirm meetings with each of Ontario's 35 public health units. We look forward to productive discussions as we work with our municipal partners to modernize the delivery of public health to. better meet the needs of communities across the province.

Big Al: Absolutely! | know there has been talk, both good and bad, about that possibility. There have been reports of Mr. Jackson saying he hated Neverland and would never live there again. Given the acts of the DA, the sheriff and ‘that family’, | do not doubt those reports. | believe eventually Mr. Jackson would have re-opened Neverland. Why do | believe that?  During my 15 years at Neverland, sitting at a picnic table under a huge oak tree, | had several long conversations with Mr. Jackson about Neverland. Looking into his eyes and hearing his voice, there is no doubt that the charity work done at Neverland was one of the most important things in his life. In time, | believe the importance of those magical days for those sick and inner city kids would have found its way back into Michael’s heart. The letters from all the doctors and nurses from children's hospitals, and the letters from parents who hung onto the memory of their child and that trip to Neverland, make it very clear how important Mr. Jackson's charity work through Neverland was.

Q. Do you remember, or, do you know whether that came from your own recollection or it was told to you by someone else?  A. | don't know. You know, what these writings, like as | talked about, the original intention of how they started, which was just for the sake of my processing, right, and then it became for the purpose of a book. You know, this reprocessing of my entire life for me through this healing process, you know, has been and will continue to be, | imagine so, for the rest of my life, meaning, you know, my perspective on things, my understanding of things, is constantly evolving as | remove the clutter from it all, remove the, the emotional and perspective repression of it all that | had compartmentalized for 22 years. So, all that to say that, you know, this process evolves as far as what |, what | remember, what comes clear and my perspective on things.  Q. So, have your memories changed as you've gone through that process?  A. They've evolved. Q. What do you mean by "evolved"?  A. Yeah, | mean, not changed in a sort of black-to-white sense. Like, | thought it was this thing -- well, | mean, they have as far as prior to the healing process, right. Prior to disclosing. But post disclosing the abuse in 2012 and beginning that-healing journey, they've evolved as far as | remember more details about scenarios. As it goes along, you know, it evolves, details get added to.

Was there something specifically you were dealing with during your time with Girls’ Generation that led you to write this?  “Thad a case of severe scoliosis that I never got to talk about growing up, and I think isn’t talked about enough in Asian culture. It’s always made me worry about whether or not I’d ever be good enough. I did ballet when I was younger, and I remember my arabesque stopped being even after 12, and I didn’t realize it was because I was physically changing. I was 16 when I found out [I had scoliosis], and it affected everything. I had already passed my growth spurt, and they were telling me I’d need surgery — I didn’t have parental guidance to help me decide what to do. The board was deciding if they should even let me stay at SM Entertainment because they worried it would affect my work.  “But I wasn’t going to quit, so it became something I had to overcome. I danced twice, 20 times, 200 times harder than everybody because I am just physically not balanced the way a normal person is. Some of the greatest prima ballerinas and athletes have it, and they overcome it with such grace that I didn’t let it beat me. It affects me all the time, and has changed me, from the way I sit to the way I stretch, and to the way I fill air into my lungs when I sing. Over time it’s become the reason why I am the way I am. But everybody has things that they struggle and deal with on their own, and you can choose to make that a positive thing to make you want to be  greater, above what your limitations are.”

NEVADA SENATE  DEMOCRATS  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE March Sth, 2019  NEVADA SENATE DEMOCRATS UNANIMOUSLY ELECT SENATOR NICOLE CANNIZZARO TO SERVE AS NEVADA SENATE MAJORITY LEADER  CARSON CITY - Following today’s resignation of Senator Kelvin Atkinson, the Nevada Senate Democrats have unanimously elected Nicole Cannizzaro to serve as the next Majority Leader of the Nevada Senate. Speaking on behalf of the Caucus, Senator Joyce Woodhouse said the following:  “Senator Cannizzaro is a revered member of the Nevada State Senate, and our Caucus is united behind her. There is no one better suited to lead us following Senator Atkinson’s departure,” said Senator Joyce Woodhouse. “In both her job as a prosecutor and as a Senator she has a long record of accomplishment while maintaining a reputation for being fair and balanced. Senator Cannizzaro has proven time and again that she is a champion for hardworking Nevadans. That’s why we have chosen her as our next Majority Leader. We have full confidence in her ability to lead us going forward.”  Senator Nicole Cannizzaro released the following statement upon her election as Majority Leader:  “I would like to thank my colleagues for the faith they have placed in me to lead them as we move forward. I am honored by their decision to elect me as their next Majority Leader. I was deeply troubled to learn of the allegations surrounding Senator Atkinson and the circumstances of his resignation today,” Senator Nicole Cannizzaro said. “His alleged conduct is in no way reflective of the standards we set for our members or the values we share as a Caucus. He was right to step down.  The trust between the people and their government is a sacred bond and must remain strong. Our Caucus will turn the page and move forward. Voters elected us to go to work and fight for them. We fully intend to spend the next 91 days doing just that. This week alone, we will hear bills that protect Nevadans with pre-existing conditions, ensure equal pay for equal work, and expand access to ballot box. We will remain focused on going to work everyday to fight for Nevadans.”  BACKGROUND: Nicole Cannizzaro was born and raised in Las Vegas. She received her undergraduate degree from UNR and her law degree from UNLV Boyd School of Law. Senator Cannizzaro works as a Chief Deputy District Attorney at the Clark County DAs Office. Cannizzaro’s election is a historic moment in the first-female majority legislature. She will be the first woman ever to serve as Majority Leader of the Nevada State Senate.

Velociraptor & Gallimimus certainly had feathers. Attachment points on  Velociraptor arm bones show  that it likely had large wings.  ‘The lineage leading to ostriches, cassowary, tinamou & kin (palaeognaths) appeared in the Cretaceous at around the same time as groups as ceratopsids & tyrannosaurids. They are a mesozoic dinosaur group that survived.     Modern birds are the only surviving group of dinosaurs.     252 mya 201 mya 145 mya 66 mya  Omya

wy  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: January 15, 2019 CONTACT: Sean Coit at 202-224-5042 or Sean Coit@coons.senate.gov  Senators urge Zimbabwe officials to respect the rights of protestors and restore access to social media, internet, and telephone services  WASHINGTON ~ U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.), both members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, released the following statement.  “We are deeply troubled by reports of deaths, widespread arrests, beatings, and harassment of protestors by security forces of the Government of Zimbabwe. The Zimbabwean people have the constitutional right to protest peacefully and express themselves regarding developments in their country. Government officials and security forces must respond with professionalism and respect for human rights and the rule of law. We also call on the Government of Zimbabwe to rescind the directive ordering communication service providers to cut or restrict access to social media, internet, and telephone services. Such abrogations of constitutional and basic legal rights are not what the people of Zimbabwe were promised under President Mnangagwa. Instead, the government should work to meet the basic economic and social needs of its people. We strongly urge the Zimbabwean authorities to resolve the current situation through dialogue and non-violent, fully legal means, and for protesters to exercise their constitutional rights peacefully. Under no circumstances should the Zimbabwean government disregard the constitutional rights of its citizens, engage in the illegal suppression of expression and assembly, or employ the disproportionate use of force or extralegal violence to respond to the current situation.”  aie

© Readmore The government is also facing increasing pressure over controversial water buybacks in 2017.  On Sunday, there were calls both a royal commission into the transactions dating from Barnaby Joyce’s period in the ministry, and an immediate explanation about why officials dealt with a company domiciled in a tax haven.  Labor has given Morrison a deadline of Monday to address questions about the 2017 water buybacks, and has not ruled out establishing a royal commission probing the various transactions in the event Bill Shorten wins the 18 May contest.

A child growing up in a deprived community, or one in which the Council has disinvested in the library, is now likely to have less access to books, reading and education, digital skills and opportunities to participate in their community than one growing up in another, more affluent, part of the country.

must break the ritual-based cycle \f Ramadan in which the Ummah (nation) has become caught up. Where fasting becomes feasting. Where the whole concept and purpose of fasting is lost. Where Ramadan has no significant impact on the society. Where the nights of Ramadan become nights of shopping and entertainment and where the religious quality of it is also unfortunately lost.

“T feel bad, I feel guilty.” Carter said. “I stole a little episode that they put out. They leaked the episode.”  But Jay-Z feels that, to a degree, he should be allowed to watch a pirated version of someone else’s work. “I think I deserved that,” he said. “What you want me to do? People bootleg my  album. I’m owed a little bit.”  Though he might be sneaking in a little illegal TV, Jay-Z still has HBO’s best interest in mind: “I watch Sunday and give them a little bit of the ratings thing. You know I’m not  gonna do them like that.”
Second term  In 2014 Buttigieg announced that he would seek a second term!*7! and went on to win the Democratic primary with 78% of the vote, defeating Henry Davis, Jr., the city councilman from the 2nd District.'4®! In November 2015 he was elected to his second term as mayor of South Bend with over 80% of the vote, defeating Republican Kelly Jones.!49!  During the 2015 controversy over Indiana Senate Bill 101—the original version of which was widely criticized for allowing discrimination against LGBT people—Buttigieg emerged as a leading opponent of the legislation, and shortly afterward came out as gay to express his solidarity,!9°!{51)

“Earlier today the Premier communicated to caucus that Dean French's advice and support was appreciated but that he no longer has any influence in this government.  The Premier has directed his staff to review all pending appointments. Additionally, if the Premier finds that people have been appointed for the wrong reason or are not performing to the highest standards those individuals will be removed from their positions.”

..... Something to Ponder  The United States has become a place where entertainers and professional athletes are mistaken for people of importance....  Storr rrr rrr rr rs I've Needed a Doctor.. I’ve Needed a Teacher.. eR Te  | have NEEDED an auto mechanic, a plumber, a house painter and a lot of other everyday people.  But I have NEVER, not even once, NEEDED a pro athlete, a media personality, or a Hollywood entertainer for ANYTHING!







Monday, April 29: It’s Monday Day!: Maybe you like Monday, or...maybe you don’t. Use a #WynonnaEarp gif or image or quote to describe Monday and share it to IDW/Syfy and remember: the hard-working people there are also facing another work week and we’re all in this together so be kind, be polite, we can all share in the fact that Mondays are balls.  Tuesday, April 30: Donuts Day!: Yep, we’re turning to food! Specifically, what donut represents each character? Bring on the funny, bring on the insightful, bring on the donuts!  Wednesday, May 1: May Flowers Day!: April Showers have ended giving rise to May Flowers! Send IDW / Syfy a dozen roses (in gif form) thanking them for three years of Wynonna Earp and asking them for another three years (or at least one or two more years). AND/OR describe what each character would be if they were a flower.  Thursday, May 2: If | Had 30 Seconds Day!: Many Earpers have had the absolute honor and pleasure to meet various members of the cast; we’ve had our 30 seconds to tell them what impact they’ve had on our lives. If YOU had 30 seconds to tell any member of the cast the impact they’ve had on you, what would you say to each of them?  Friday, May 3: Pass it On Day!: On this day, tweet “It’s been 10 weeks. | still love #WynonnaEarp. | still #FightForWynonna. Pass it on. @IDWPublishing @Syfy” And then also quote retweet others that tweeted this.

Three people said they were socialists. | guess in this beautiful area one has to be quite well off to afford socialism. A great deal of ignorance about energy production shown by the few who raised climate change. A tip: electricity has to be generated somewhere before it can be stored in a battery.

It’s “BoSS TIME” FOR  RONDA ROUSEY  Embodying everything WWE’s fresh start under the McMahon family stands for, Sasha Banks seized opportunity this past Monday night, challenging Nia Jax for the right to challenge Ronda Rousey for the Raw Women’s Championship at the WWE Royal Rumble event. With best friend Bayley neutralizing the threat of Tamina at ringside, The Boss handled her business with The Irresistible Force, making her foe tap out to the Bank Statement.     Now, Banks is set to go up against The Baddest Woman on the Planet on Jan. 27 in Phoenix. Can The Boss do what no one has been able to do in WWE and unseat The Rowdy One?

Nadler Statement on Partisan Gerrymandering SCOTUS Case  “Lam very disappointed by the Supreme Court's decision today holding that constitutional challenges to partisan gerrymandering are political questions beyond the reach of judicial remedy. Partisan gerrymandering is fundamentally corrosive to democracy. Democratic government is required by definition to reflect the popular will. Gerrymandering undermines democratic government by enabling minority factions to control state and local governments against the majority will, and to perpetuate that control by enacting gerrymanders. Just as with the one person, one vote cases, there is no political solution to this problem.  “The Courts decision today will allow politicians to continue to pick their voters, rather than allow voters to pick their politicians. Itis my hope, however, that today’s decision will spur the American people into action to demand that lawmakers put aside partisan political advantage when drawing electoral maps, as. called for in HR 1, the For the People Act.”  ane

To people, we say don’t fall in the same trap every day. Don’t vote, because even if you vote, you will be dragged by the bonnet and humiliated. If you stay away from the ballots, you will save yourself from their bullets in the long run. Those who beg you for votes are being sold as peoples’ support to the integrationist agenda. Stay away from them; you may be deprived of a sadak, but that a small sacrifice against the deceit they play with you. If you don't shame them in the society, they will continue to shame you as a nation.  ~ Manan Wani

a  NSW’s lesson for Vics  The best way to prevent violence against women isnot through Victoria's politically correct pong but rather with cos onthe beat and by being honest withthe public     he terrifying rape and mur-  der of yet another young  woman in Melbourne by a  stranger is cause to doubt  Victoria’s police force, par- ole decisions, legal system and mental health services. It is not an excuse to blame all men for the evil of a few ab- errant predators.  Yet, shockingly, in the wake of the murder last week of 21-year-old Israe- listudent Aiia Maasarwe as she walk- ed home alone from the tram after a night out with friends, the focus is not on how best to keep women safe from_. predators in the future.

Rossi, Rector of the Basilica Regarding the Notre Dame Cathedral Fire  “Today we share our grief and prayers with those who worship at the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, the millions who have visited and experienced this sacred place, and the people of Paris who have lost a sacred landmark. Holy Week is a time when we celebrate the Paschal mystery - the passion, death, and Resurrection of Jesus. In solidarity with our friends at Notre Dame in Paris, and seeking the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary for all those affected by the tragedy, the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception will toll its bells 50 times (representing the 50 Hail Marys of Our Lady's Rosary) at 6 p.m. this evening local time/ midnight Paris time to mourn this tragedy, and to mark the beginning of a new day of hope and resurrection for Notre Dame Cathedral.”  FOR MORE INFORMATION  Jacquelyn Hayes Director of Communications Office: 202-281-0615 Mobile: 202-309-2161 jhayes@bnsic.org

Change is hard. If you’re a seasoned teacher, why change? Teaching isn’t just math, science, and English anymore; it’s everything. Students need us to teach them how to be successful. They need to learn the skills necessary for resolving conflict, using their voices, and mak- ing things right when they stumble. A ticket to the principal’s office won’t do any of that, but sitting down with them to discuss their actions and teach them how to improve will.

Ability to prevent cross-talk narrows comms only to FAKE NEWS which provides for more control over what is released to inform the public.  Aseries of scenarios is currently being conducted ['game the sys'] to test response, risk, and calc results.  ‘Censorship’ [added] layers of inserted code ‘through keyword targeting’ in bio, history, and comments + indiv platform mods has failed to curtail the problem.  ‘China-Russia-lran’ ‘fake' take-down hacks of select platforms (for maintenance) is one scenario being game-played.  [Zero-Day]  Countermeasures in place.  [Example]  Think Emergency Alert System.  Think WH controlled *new* RT 'news' website Think WH controlled *new* video stream platform  Think Here.  Should this occur, immediate steps will be taken to classify each as ‘Public Utility’ (essential public services) to gain appropriate gov regulation (control).  Why do we make things public?  Q

Who benefited, or was damaged, by this focus on alleged Russia collusion? and what new revelations can we expect as we approach 2020.

Hi Tron Community,  As hoped for, the Tron Foundation has been great about communicating and keeping the sub up to date. As the news about Lucien Chen was significant, | asked for an official response. Here it is:  According to the inspection department of TRON, former employees Z. Chen, J. Zhu, and X. Xie are suspected of misappropriation of funds, bribery, competitive infringement, and theft of trade secrets and intellectual property. Chen, Zhu, and Xie were dismissed in January, 2019 for violation of corporate policies and the law. Relevant documents and materials have been handed over to the judiciary. Z. Chen joined TRON in October, 2017 not as a co-founder but rather a technical leader.  As aside note, The [internal] inspection department was most likely stepped up after/during the GOC incident which occurred at the same time.

Heaven help rugby now  Throwing the good book at rugby's best player marks the start ofa repressive new dark age      ustralian Rugby will rue the day that it sacked its best player Israel Folau for quoting a Bible verse on Instagram.  While sportspeople like tennis star Nick Kyrgios can throw chairs around the court and behave dis- gracefully yet keep their careers, Folau must be eliminated because he has committed the only sin worthy of punishment today — causing offence to rainbow totalitarians.  Liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists and idolaters (aka Catholics) didn’t take umbrage at being told to repent toavoid hell.  Folau’s Bible quote on his private Instagram account would have gone ‘unnoticed if it weren't for activists on the hunt for offence who pretend to speak for all homosexual people, most of whom just wish they'd shut up and eave well enough alone.

First of all i would like to apologize for posting that hurtful instagram post, at the time i thought it was funny but looking back it was distasteful and insensitive.. | have to be honest though it was my caption and post that | screenshoted of scooter and Kanye that said “taylor swift what up” he didnt have anything to do with it and it wasnt even a part of the conversation in all actuality he was the person who told me not to joke like that.. Scooter has had your back since the days you graciously let me open up for you.! As the years have passed we haven't crossed paths and gotten to communicate our differences, hurts or frustrations. So for you to take it to social media and get people to hate on scooter isn’t fair. What were you trying to accomplish by posting that blog? seems to me like it was to get sympathy ualso knew that in posting that your fans would go and bully scooter. Anyway, One thing i know is both scooter and i love you. | feel like the only way to resolve conflict is through communication. So banter back and fourth online i dont believe solves anything. I'm sure Scooter and i would love to talk to you and resolve any conflict, pain or or any feelings that need to be addressed. Neither scooter or i have anything negative to say about you we truly want the best for you. | usually don’t rebuttal things like this but when you try and deface someone i loves character thats crossing a line..

So.....The show opened with a scene where a midget finds his brother and sister dead under a pile of rocks (well, not really a pile, they kinda only had like 7 rocks on top of them, but either way, they were dead). Shortly thereafter a 500 foot dragon got pissed some dude killed his mother, so he stared the guy down and lit a chair on fire and flew away (weird flex). After the main character saved the world he got banished to the wilderness by his family and friends to play w/ his dog. Everyone got together and tried to pick a king, but no one knew what the fuck was going on, so they just made some weird jokes and drank Poland Spring water. Finally, the rulers from all over the world (most of which haven't been seen in years, or ever before) decided it was best to let the prisoner choose the new ruler of the 7 kingdoms (which will end up being 6....1 think), while on death row (yes, that happened). The prisoner (who is also a midget) chose some mute crippled kid (who is also a bird) to rule the world, in spite of him saying he had no interest in ruling for the whole season. Ina shocking plot twist, when asked if he wanted to be king, the cripple said now that he did indeed want to be king and that he actually did all along, even though he kept saying he didn’t (turns out he was just kidding). The cripple then freed the prisoner and made him really powerful, then the prisoner held a meeting (with a bunch of ppl who should be dead already) and they had some awkward conversation about brothels. The end.

He stopped in the parsonage: he tapped: like lightning it flashed on me what was coming. He entered — he stood before me. What his words were — you can guess; his manner you can hardly realize — nor can I ever forget it. Shaking from head to foot, looking deadly pale, speaking low, vehemently yet with difficulty — he made me feel what it costs a man to declare affection where he doubts response... The poignant pity inspired by his state on Monday evening — by the hurried revelation of his sufferings for many months, is something galling and irksome. That he cared something for me, and wanted me to care for him, I have long suspected — but I did not know the degree or strength of his feelings.

Statement by Monsignor Walter R. Rossi, Rector of the Basilica Regarding the Notre Dame Cathedral Fire  “Today we share our grief and prayers with those who worship at the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, the millions who have visited and experienced this sacred place, and the people of Paris who have lost a sacred landmark. Holy Week is a time when we celebrate the Paschal mystery — the passion, death, and Resurrection of Jesus. In solidarity with our friends at Notre Dame in Paris, and seeking the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary for all those affected by the tragedy, the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception will toll its bells 50 times (representing the 50 Hail Marys of Our Lady's Rosary) at 6 p.m. this evening local time/midnight Paris time to mourn this tragedy, and to mark the beginning of a new day of hope and resurrection for Notre Dame Cathedral.”

Raj Narayanan  Negative reviews!! Do you know why there’s so much of negative reviews from non Rajini fans? Because KS found the vintage Rajini back and these non Rajini fans and trade pundits are scared - for what if Rajini comes back again and again like this and starts to win more?! They are more keen of a Kabali and Kaala type movie - for they want their hero to occupy the “mass hero” space!  So ... vidungappal!!!  Go and listen to Ullaala songs with lyrics! Understand and play that to those stomach burning trade pundits and non Rajini fans!!  Enjoy madi!!  Happy Pongal friends!

Then too, countless hundreds of comic books went down, ond the long-gone EC ones certainly hod thew effect Science fiction, fantasy, and horror movies w     a big influence. In foct all of us tend to get ample helpings of fantasy when we ore very young from fairy tales such os those written by the Brothers Grimm and Andrew Lang.

ARIES RANDOM THOUGHTS      Looking forward to UFC 238 this weekend. The card is solid from top to bottom. Henry Cejudo vs. Marlon Moraes and Tony Ferguson vs. Cowboy Cerrone are fight of the year contenders in the making. Love those fights.     Remember when the light heavy- weight division was embarrassingly shallow with no good prospects coming up? | think those days are definitely over. Now we have (in no particular order): Thiago Santos, Dominick Reyes, Johnny Walker, Aleksandar Rakic and Corey Anderson, among others.  | do hope Gustafsson walks away with his head held high. If you ask me, his UFC 165 battle against Jones remains the greatest UFC fight ever. He also doesn't get the credit he deserves for pushing Daniel Cormier to his limits at UFC 192.

7 MONEY & OWNERSHIP LESSONS BY NIPSEY HUSSLE  @KEZIAMW | #PROFESSORKEZ  1.0N HUSTLENOMICS - You learn all the secrets to the game on your way up. Most folk want to skip the process when you skip steps, you miss the lessons.  2.ON TURN UP v OWN UP - It isn’t cool to be in the club spending all of this money, or having cars and jewelry — but you don’t own any real estate? a fourplex? If the answer is no, you’re not a real hustler.  3.ENTREPRENEURSHIP - The new mindset is we don’t want advances, we want equity. We don’t want 1-off endorsements, we want ownership.”  4.BLACK CAPITAL - Biz models are built around our cultural currency. They develop the platform, implement structure & bring us in to raise value.  5.ON BREAKING THE CHAINS - Own the supply chain from production to consumption. People take shots at Jay-Z but he’s the first Black artist to have a vertically integrated biz model where he owns the whole chain.  6.ON CREATING VALUE -| released 100 mixtaps and charged $1000 for each because | understood the economic principle of scarcity. The profit funded my independent label.  7.O0N OWNING REAL ESTATE -| own the block where | used to hustle from 8am to 10pm. | hustled, then | rented now me and David Gross will own in Crenshaw.

Blood in the water but experts are still at sea on shark danger  It is increasingly dangerous to enter the surf but authorities are in denial     FRED PAWLE     ‘The kids were screaming ... like a scene from Jaws’  MICHELLE BATTERHAM  Sharks causing beach closures be- came the new normal in Australia this summer.  Cid Harbour, in the world-  ofthe danger.  Butit’s not always that smooth. Michelle Batterham, from Ballina, NSW, wasat Southwall, one of her local beaches, with a couple of other families the week before Christmas when a beach closure wentslightly awry.  Tt began when she saw the shark-spotting helicopter about 500m south, flying low and cire- ling a spot in the water, which is one of the many expensively inef- fective ways authorities try to make beaches safe these days.  After a while it must have seemed to the helicopter pilot that itwould be easier just to get every- one out of the water, Batterham says. So he flew the 500m to Southwall, hovered 10m above the water turned onthesiren andtold  “It’sa smorgasbord forsharksif you go to Bondi. There are flav- ours from every nation,” he is quoted as saying, applying the an- thropomorphism common in eco- logical studies these days.  ‘When two people were killed by sharks in Western Australia in 2012, NSW Department of Pri- mary Industries shark expert Vic Peddemors jokingly referred to them as a “bumper season”.  He also assured his audience that the rate of attackssoon would decrease. It has done the opposite.  University of Queensland re- searcher George Roff this month reported that the population of tiger sharks in that state had de- clined by 92 per cent in 50 years.  This conclusion was based solely on the numbers caught in the nets and drumlines installed to  protect people at popular beaches in Queensland. TRH cimmuatie her tous

Former Vice President Joe Biden lost one of his top fundraisers after controversial comments regarding his work with past segregationists and his flip-flop on repealing the Hyde Amendment, CNBC has learned.  Tom McInerney, a veteran San Francisco based lawyer, informed Biden's team on June 20 that he can no longer help him raise campaign cash to compete in the 2020 presidential election.  "L had actually let the campaign known I'd pulled back my support of Biden for now,” McInerney told CNBC. "I don't think he did well last night," he added, reflecting on Biden's debate performance on Thursday night.

At the Department of Justice, we stand watch over what Attomey General Robert Jackson called “the inner ramparts of our society — the Constitution, its guarantees, our freedoms and the supremacy of law.” As a result, the Department bears a special responsibility to avoid partisanship. Political considerations may fluence policy choices, but neutral principles must drive decisions about individual cases. In 1940, Jackson explained that government lawyers “must at times risk ourselves and our records to defend our legal processes from discredit, and to maintain a dispassionate, disinterested, and impartial enforcement of the law.” Facing “corrosive skepticism and cynicism concerning the administration of justice” in 1975, Edward Levi urged us to “make clear by word and deed that our law is not an instrument of partisan purpose, and it is not ... to be used in ways which are careless of the higher values ... within us all.” In 2001, John Ashcroft called for “a professional Justice Department ... free from politics ... uncompromisingly fair ... defined by integrity and dedicated to upholding the rule of law.”                             We enforce the law without fear or favor because credible evidence is not partisan, and truth is not determined by opinion polls. We ignore fleeting distractions and focus our attention on the things that matter, because a republic that endures is not governed by the news cycle.     We keep the faith, we follow the rules, and we always put America first.     Robert H. Jackson, Chief U.S. Prosecutor at the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, Germany, 1945-46

Would Britain vote for Brexit again?  Pollsters since the 2016 referendum have continued to pose the Leave/Remain question to voters. Below is our tracker estimating how Britain would vote if a  second referendum featuring the same question was held today.        Sep ‘16  Jan'17 May "17 sep'17 Jan'18 May "18 Sep 18





Merkley Responds to State of the Union Address  WASHINGTON, D.C. — Oregon’s U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley released the following statement after President Trump’s 2019 State of the Union address on Tuesday night:  “Our nation faces three incredibly daunting challenges today: the corruption of our democracy; the undermining of the fundamentals for thriving families; and carbon pollution driving climate chaos and threatening the future of our planet.  “For over an hour and a half, the American people listened to President Trump deliver his State of the Union address, and not once did we hear him confront any of these major challenges  “This wasn’t an address designed to bring America together. It was a profoundly partisan speech lacking in any kind of leadership.  “What we heard was that President Trump continues to be focused on dividing Americans rather than uniting us. He remains singularly focused on his unpopular, racist wall, and in using terror and trauma as a deterrence against refugees seeking asylum  “and he made it crystal clear that he is terrified of any kind of investigation or oversight from Congress. It’s no wonder why; this president has continually lied to and misled the American people from the moment he took the oath of office. And he continued to do so tonight with his fearmongering claims of a crisis along our southern border.  “There is, in fact, a crisis at our border. But it’s a humanitarian crisis that President Trump and his administration created with their family separation policy. My guests to the State of the Union were a mother and a daughter who fled Guatemala fearing for their lives and who experienced the horror of the president's humanitarian crisis firsthand. Albertina Contreras Teletor and her daughter Yakelin Garcia Contreras—who tured 12 years old today—were separated for a terrifying two months at the southern border in the spring of 2018. President Trump could have looked up to where they sat in the chamber balcony, and assured them that nothing like this would ever happen in the United States again. Instead, he lied to the American people about a fabricated national security threat, and insisted yet again that a fourth-century wall will keep out the ‘threat’ of vulnerable families like Yakelin and Albertina.  “My response to the president is this: The state of our union will only be stronger when we invest in working families; when we reclaim our position as a beacon of hope and humanity in the world; and when we embrace our own diversity as the fundamental strength of our nation.”

Re: Human Capital comments  To say Jason Kenney’s words were twisted would be an understatement. At no point does he suggest what he is accused of. Instead his opponents attack rather than working to help those with disabilities and special needs.  Last March Mr. Kenney asked to tour Horizon School in Olds. Horizon is a specialized educational facility for children with complex and medical needs. He witnessed the lack of space and was shocked to see teachers using broom closets for offices. They are literally bursting at the seams and desperately need a new school.  Mr. Kenny has voiced his support for persons with disabilities and special needs and | fully believe if UCP forms government he will help us in Olds. There is much that needs to be done here.  Mr Kenny heard from families during the tour who have kids graduating from Horizon and they explained how graduation is not typically a happy time because it means the loss of programs and resources our kids desperately need. Kids age out of this program but it sure doesn’t mean they don’t continue to need what this school has been able to give them.  Mr Kenney heard how we have been advocating for better services in Olds and that there is a high population of special needs people here. In fact, Special Olympics stats show that Olds has by far the highest concentration of people with special needs (directly related to the almost 50 years that Horizon has been here). More choice and programming is needed so our kids can be the best they can be and have an improved quality of life.  | look forward to working with Mr Kenny in achieving this and | am truly disappointed that the current government has done nothing in 4 years to help us.  As the parent of a son who graduated from Horizon school and who | continue to advocate for, | look forward to working with Mr Kenney to do the right thing and look after our most vulnerable citizens.  Thank you Mr Kenney

23. Paul George once called him “one of the most influential men in  my life.”  24. David West on the “unwavering optimism and belief” from Vogel: “It doesn’t matter how well you played or how bad you played, he doesn't waver on his belief and trust in how well you can, when everything is right and you're playing at your best, how good you can be. That hasn't changed. That’s been a mainstay of his — the ability to keep guys afloat, keep them engaged in the fight.”

I wanted to tell her how much I was genuinely dreading seeing Jason but couldn’t figure out why. I wanted to explain that the thought of him going in for our first kiss was making me want to scratch out my eyes, and yet, I still really wanted this date to happen, and I really wanted it to go well.  But, of course, at the time, I didn’t know how to explain any of that.

Thought To Heart  © 49 wi =O  According to my subconscious I've given all submission to you. It might be facetious at now, But I still believe this connection is real.  No mind would always revert to such, Yet your beautiful self was inserted in me. Are we inverts? No I am perverted by you. Thought of you always converts to heartbeat.  Your soul is permanently ravishing to I. Yes, I know the feeling will be punishing. I want you now, thus I will bow to tarnish. Wish me luck in vanishing these feelings.

The Labour leader is increasingly isolated at the top of the party on Brexit, with senior figures including shadow chancellor John McDonnell and deputy leader  Tom Watson demanding a public vote. Mr Corbyn sought to reach out to Remainers yesterday, stating: “We are ready to support a public vote on any deal.” But it is understood that the shift of tone does not amount to a change in policy.

AMTINNOCENT  Paris Jackson was around nine years old when she realized that much of the world didn’t see her father the way she did. “My dad would cry to me at night,” she says, sitting at the counter of a New York coffee shop in mid- December, cradling a tiny spoon in her hand. She starts to cry too. “Picture your parent crying to you about the world hating him for something he didn’t do. And for me, he was the only thing that mattered. To see my entire world in pain, I started to hate the world because of what they were doing to him. I'm like, ‘How can people be so mean?”     Paris and Prince have no doubts that their father was innocent of the multiple child-molestation allegations against him, that the man they knew was the real Michael.

McCormack backs One Nation  Michael Koziol Fergus Hunter  Deputy Prime Minister Michael ‘McCormack says a preference “deal” between the Nationals and Pauline Hanson’s One Nation “just makes sense” because the parties’ policies closely align and it will help ‘the Coalition win the election.  ‘The Nationals leader also warned his predecessor and rival, Barnaby Joyce, to concentrate on winning his seat of New England after dominat- ing national headlines early in the campaign courtesy of the water buy- back scandal.  Senator Hanson has announced she will give preferential treatment to Nationals MPs and certain Liber- als on how-to-vote cards, giving the government a boost in key marginal seats, while in Queensland the Lib- eral National Party is directing pref- erences to One Nation above Labor and the Greens in half a dozen seats.  ‘Mr McCormack said preferences ‘were amatter for the party’sexecut- ive but “ifit’s a deal that benefits the National Party... then P'm certainly not against it”.  “The fact is [Pauline Hanson] ac- Kmowledges that our policies are more closely aligned with the in- terests and wants of her voters than the Greens or Labor,” he told The Age in Mackay yesterday.  “She, like us, is concerned that the Greens want to close down min- ‘ing by 2030. She, like us, is con- cerned about: Labor's land lockout laws under the guise of native vege- tation laws. She, like us, is con-     cerned about regional Queensland. So it just makes sense that she has put us above other candidates.”  ‘Mr McCormack said the same ap- plied in reverse - that One Nation's policies aligned more closely with the desires of Coalition voters — which was why his party was giving preferences to One Nation above Labor in key Queensland seats.  He acknowledged some state- ments by One Nation people “in the past, indeed in the recent past”, ‘were unpalatable.  Michael McCormack says there are similarities between the Natlonals and One Nation. Photo: Dominic Lorrimer  “Butat the end ofthe day, we'rein an election,” Mr McCormack said. “You can’t be altruistic and then after May 18 just be shouting from the sidelines and be in opposition and wishing you had done some- thing else. We want to win.”  While Coalition preferences in the lower house hardly ever come into play, minor parties’ support for the Coalition is likely to be crucial in close contests such as Capricornia, Flynn, Dickson and Petrie in Queensland — where minor parties      will net a strong primary vote but won't be contenders to win the seat.  The Liberal Party has committed to putting One Nation below Labor.  A stoush over the preferences of Clive Palmer's United Australia Party escalated on Monday, with Labor Senator Anthony Chisholm denying he sought a deal with Mr Palmer on behalf of the party before relations soured.  Labor has lashed the Coalition’s preference deal with Mr Palmer and criticised the billionaire’s failure to     e     ay out entitlements to workers laid off from his Queensland Nickel re- finery after its collapse in 2016.  Mr Palmer has accused Labor of lying about negotiations and la- belled Opposition Leader Bill Shor- ten “morally unfit” to be prime min- ister. The Rich Lister outlined a series of discussions with Senator Chisholm allegedly about prefer- ences. He said the senator had ap- proached him asa “fully authorised” negotiator for Labor.  Senator Chisholm said Mr Pal- mer was “chaotic and dishonest” and insisted he was merely doing “due diligence” for the election.  ‘Amid ongoing criticism over the collapse of his nickel refinery, Mr Palmer said $7 million had been transferred to an independent trust and would shortly be available for workers owed entitlements.  Mr McCormack would not dis- cuss whether he would throw open the Nationals leadership ifthe Coali- tion loses the election. But he com- mitted to serving a full term as the member for Riverina if re-elected.

; OKLAHOMA -


“The President’s proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2020 would gut services that are vital to working families, seniors and some of our most vulnerable neighbors. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would be reduced by $220 billion, slashing the program by one- quarter and literally taking food from hungry children and working people. The Budget assumes once again that the Affordable Care Act would be rolled back, scrapping protections for those with preexisting conditions and undermining healthcare for all Americans, something we cannot and will not allow to happen.  “T was particularly alarmed at how this budget would slash funding for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, undermining housing programs that are vital to the wellbeing of New Yorkers. HUD would see a cut overall of more than 16%. Ata time when the New York City Housing Authority needs robust funding to remediate mold, fix boilers, tackle lead paint, this budget zeroes out the federal Public Capital Housing Fund. At the same time, the budget proposes eliminating completely the Community Development Block Grant initiative, a vital cornerstone of healthy, livable communities.  “These draconian cuts are immoral and unacceptable. Congress has defeated them in the past. I fully intend to join with my colleagues in rejecting these cuts and fighting for additional funds for housing and other programs so critical to our City.  “Tt is sadly ironic that as the President’s budget proposes these coldhearted cuts to domestic spending, he is once again pursuing funds for a hateful, ineffective border wall. The last time Donald Trump shut down the government over this issue, he secured not a single dollar for his foolish wall, but he did harm our economy and thousands of dedicated federal workers and subcontractors. [hope he learned his lesson and will not once again pursue this losing strategy.”

Government statement on outcome of ‘Meaningful Vote’ in Westminster  The Government regrets the outcome of the vote in Westminster this evening on the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated between the UK Government and the European Union.  This outcome will add to uncertainty about the nature of the UK withdrawal from the EU. The Government urges the UK to set out how it proposes to move forward. We will then consider what next steps to take in consultation with our EU partners.  The Withdrawal Agreement was concluded, following lengthy and detailed negotiations, as a fair and balanced compromise to a very complicated situation. The Irish Government continues to believe that ratification of this Agreement is the best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK, which avoids a hard border and respects the single market and Customs Union, while also delivering on the UK’s objectives for withdrawal  The Irish Government recalls the clear position of the European Council at its meeting of 13 December when it stated that the Withdrawal Agreement is not open for renegotiation. This was restated in the joint letter from Presidents Tusk and Juncker to Prime Minister May yesterday.  Regrettably, the outcome of tonight's vote increases the risk of a disorderly Brexit. Consequently, the Government will continue to intensify preparations for such an outcome. Earlier today, Cabinet discussed preparation for a ‘no deal’ Brexit in detail. Cabinet took a number of significant decisions, including the preparation of essential legislative  measures as part of this ongoing work. This work which will intensify over the next few weeks.  The Irish Government recognises, however, that a disorderly Brexit is a bad outcome for everyone, not least in Northern Ireland. It is not too late to avoid this outcome and we call on the UK to set out how it proposes to resolve this impasse as a matter of urgency.  ENDS

Today's ##WCW is Cynthia Erivo. Her talent is GIGANTIC! I will gleefully admit to going down the rabbit hole of her performances on YouTube and cheering and weeping at her brilliance. Iist met her at the end of a long line for portraits at the Vanity Fair Oscar party and in the ist few moments after introduction, we hugged like long lost family members. I truly SAW her in her fullness of spirit and she SAW me. It's a moment I will never forget and always cherish. Sometimes you meet your crushes and they are everything you need them to be and so much more. Cynthia is so much more. After earning a Tony for Best Leading Actress in "The Color Purple" Erivo wasn't stopping anytime soon. Known for her work in Step (2017), Widows (2018) and Bad Times at the El Royale (2018), Erivo has proven to tackle the transition from Broadway to the big screen flawlessly. Keep an eye out for Chaos Walking - her next feature film coming out March 2019. Let us lift her up in the light of goodness and hold her there.

Anonymous 01/16/19 (Wed) 11:43:51 ID: 3ba276 (8) No.4778338 >>4778519 >>4778684  Arkansas Medicaid rolls fall by 18,000 after 7 months of work requirements  The rules stipulate that to keep Medicaid in Arkansas, certain beneficiaries have to report to the state that they have worked, volunteered, or taken classes for at least 80 hours a month. Three consecutive months of failing work, or to report the work, results in a loss of Medicaid. At the start of the program, people were only allowed to log their hours online, but beginning Dec. 19, people were allowed to begin reporting their work requirements by phone.  The requirements apply to adults who are not disabled and who qualify for government- funded Medicaid coverage because they make less than $17,000 a year. They don't need to be followed for the majority of people on the program, including caregivers, parents, or those receiving addiction treatment.  https:/Avww.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/he althcare/arkansas-medicaid-rolls-fall-by-18- 000-after-7-months-of-work-requirements

First Group Since the Beatles to Earn Three No. 1s in Less Than a Year: It’s uncommon for any act to tally three Billboard 200 No. 1s in less than a year. How rare? Before BTS, the last traditional group (excluding the Glee ensemble, whose multiple cast members rotated) to log three leaders within such a quick span was the Beatles in 1995-96, when the band's archival releases Anthology 1, Anthology 2 and Anthology 3 all debuted at No. 1 ina stretch of 11 months and a week (between Dec. 9, 1995  and Nov. 16, 1996).

Andrew Elliot: Whats wrong with F1? 1) Fix the problem with following other cars. 2) Stop changing the tyres every year. 3) Reduce data collecting by teams. 4) Hidden / Free choice of tyres to start race. 5) Track runoffs need gravel or similar. 6) Equal distribution of prize money.  Richard Smith: F1 has had dominate teams before, McLaren in the 80s, Ferrari early 00s and the four years of Red Bull before the Silver Arrows, it will change soon but in the meantime let's enjoy watching a British Driver in a British built car rule the world.  bslaveboy: The problem is that teams have no incentive to make cars that can overtake. Replace qualifying with a qualifying race where teams start in reverse championship order. Finishing position determines grid slot

Tell the House Education Committee to Not Arm Teachers!  House Education Committee Proposed Commit- tee Bill EDC 19-02 will be heard at 8am on Thurs- day, March 21.  This bill would expand the current “Guardian Program” and potentially arm teachers.  Legislators must stop looking for quick, inexpen- sive fixes. To truly make our students and staff safer, lawmakers should invest money in ensuring every school has a resource officer and a suffi- cient number of trained mental health profession- als such as guidance counselors, school psychol- ogists and social workers.

Suzy Davies - Author  Suzy started writing at a tender age. "Paddington Bear’ and Kipling’s "Just So” stories were her favorite childhood books. She was delighted to rediscover these tales, when recently, she saw Sheila Graber's wonderful animation of these stories. Shortly afterwards, a real runaway piggy in Suzy's back yard inspired her to write this book, and she shared Luna's story with Sheila, “just for fun”  Little Luna quickly captivated both illustrator and writer, who fell in love with her. They hope that their fairy tale, “Luna The Moon Pig, with its “Moonwishes Magic” will entertain children all over the world!  Sheila Graber - Illustrator  Sheila Graber, (pronounced Gray-Bear,) is an artist and animator. Her productions include the animation of the classic, “Paddington Bear,” and his family, and animation of Kipling’s “Just So” stories With a deep empathy for all animals, Sheila was greatly moved by Suzy's story, “Snugs the Snow Bear.” On reading her draught script for Luna, she “just had to get drawing.” Suzys story of “Luna The Moon Pig’ is based in reality, with a touch of magic. So, the spirit of the story and its characters is uniquely conveyed by Sheila with a combination of Rotoscoped Photographs, and hand drawn cartoon-style illustrations that range, like the story, from ‘Whimsical to Wonderful! All designed to bring this remarkable story alive for the reader. Enjoy!  LUNA THE MOON PIG The Pig Who Hid  Written by Suzy Davies Illustrated by Sheila Graber

OTTAWA PARAMEDIC SERVICE RSet gay Wala ed kena NZ     On May 29, 2019, at 11:43, the Ottawa Paramedic Service with Ottawa Fire and Ottawa Police responded to the intersection of Ladybirds and Sirocco in Stittsville to an individual who had his forearm trapped in the back loader of a garbage truck.  Given the complexity of the entrapment, the Ottawa Paramedic Service contacted the Ottawa Hospital and the Regional Paramedic Program of Eastern Ontario to have a surgical team dispatched to the scene in the anticipation of a possible field amputation.  ‘An Ornge helicopter was requested as well and arrived around 13:00 followed shortly after by the surgical team. With the assistance of an employee from the waste disposal company, first responders were able to remove the patient’s arm out of the truck and place the patient in the care of the Ornge Flight Paramedics.  He was taken to the Trauma Centre by helicopter in serious but stable condition.  ‘We want to recognize the amazing team efforts between our paramedics, Ottawa Fire, Ornge, Ottawa Police, The Ottawa Hospital, the Regional Paramedic Program for Eastern Ontario and the waste disposal company. Through their teamwork, the patient’s arm was saved from amputation.  ‘We also want to wish our patient a prompt recovery.

These actions are now being monitored and would strongly encourage Ng this information to the appropriate              forwai     members of Congress, Senate and the media. believe this is a ‘test run’ to effectively silence the opposition while testing the potential media backlash response. This attempt to     and/or remove/silence (‘FASCISM’) those who oppose their view/narrative should further demonstrate their resolve to control the ‘message’ / ‘narrative’ (win at any cost)  Q #2881     HRC’s 2 is not just for those on the list. It will quickly become who’s next  Stand with your Patriot Brothers and Sisters as we all are just a click away from being silenced  “Be Loud — Be Heard”  A hit on ONE is a hit on us ALL

UP Maura Higgins  CW'S feminist role model at the moment is Maura from Love Island. Indeed, CW would go as far as saying that, in Maura from Love Island, the world has found the woman who has been categorically least damaged by | growing up in a patriarchy. CW wants to study her the way astronomers study distant galaxies, murmuring: “How did it get there? Will we ever understand? Why wasn't 90 per cent of her sexuality mangled and crushed before she got to her I4th birthday — like every other woman on Earth — and is now primarily only expressable ina series of memes of puppies interacting excitedly with Mark Ruffalo, captioned ‘IT ME’? How has this happened? HOW?”  At first glance, Maura Higgins — a 28-year-old model and grid girl from Co Longford in Ireland — would not strike you as the greatest icon of female liberation since Gloria Steinem. | Her Instagram account is all “bikinis in Dubai” and powerful testament to ‘a powerful underboob game. If you're super into half-tits, this is totally the girl for you.  However, since entering Love Island last week, Higgins has revealed herself to be the horniest and most chaotic female sexual energy seen on British television, and blessed with a punchy line in neologisms — the filthy, cheerful, appreciative cry of “He gives me fanny flutters” has instantly entered the lexicon of 3.3 million        viewers. This was within just five minutes of entering the Love Island house — causing the other contestants to spit their drinks out in mock-horror,  ' the door open... with her fanny.  | novelty, the second part of Maura’s  | ABSOLUTELY KNOWS HER  | may make judgments about her.

' with Tom, Maura overheard him  | edgelording to the other men, “Let's  | find out if she’s all mouth and no. | trousers,” she called him “a dickhead”,  ' were just showing off to the other lads.                                                                   the other contestants are persistently coy about the fact they're in a sex zoo. In terms of entrances, Maura is  basically a lady sex-pirate who kicked  However, even though seeing such a knowingly thirsty expression of female lubriciousness is, in itself, a delightful  unprecedented joyousness is that SHE  WORTH AND HAS SUPER-FIRM BOUNDARIES. Yes, she talks honestly and amusingly about sex — but that doesn't mean other people     use her sexuality to crush her. It's as if she defines her own value and has never been broken in an informal  as a school playground or small  When, before embarking on a date  cancelled the date, blocked his every attempt to gaslight her (“I didn't mean it like that!” “Yes, you did”), and explained, with cold, precise fury, why his behaviour was objectionable (“You  ‘That's the behaviour of a child — not agentleman’). When, finally enlightened, he became truly repentant and mortified, she graciously forgave him — then made him brush her hair while she ate a biscuit. It was the most beautiful, righteous, playful piece of feminist schooling CW has had the privilege to witness. Everyone came out of it a better person, CW can only presume that Maura Higgins is a time traveller from a feminist Utopia, 1,000 years in the future, who has travelled back to the 2ist century to given womankind hope. Why pick Love Island? Because every man and woman under 25 watches it. She's brainwashing an entire

WILLIAM BARR: I'd rather, in many ways, I'd rather be back to my old life but I think that I love the Department of Justice, I love the FBI, I think it's important that we not, in this period of intense partisan feeling, destroy our institutions. I think one of the ironies today is that people are saying that it’s President Trump  that's shredding our institutions. I really see no evidence of that, itis hard, and I really haven't seen bill of particulars as to how that's being done. From my  perspective the idea of resisting a democratically elected president and basically throwing everything at him and you know, really changing the norms onthe grounds that we have to stop this president, that is where the shredding of our normsand ourinstitutionsisoccurrmg. =~—~S*~<CS

(E3 mining machine, developed by BitMain in 2018, shows that Ethash cannot resist ASIC optimization.)

HAZARD  Temperatures will likely be right around freezing, which means more wintry precipitation is possible.        LOCATION  Much of the area could be impacted.     CONFIDENCE  Widespread precip is likely across the region. However, minor changes in the storm track will result in drastic changes to precipitation type and amount. With over 4 days until this event, please continue to watch for forecast updates.            De OL mee oo ese oe ge Cae)

Julian Assange ®  _ @JulianAssange UK judgement in Appeal No: EA/2017/0041  starts hitting the high notes, then rules that all information about US attempts to extradite me from the UK, even the number of pages kept by the UK must be kept secret.  d. So far as the evidence before us goes, Mr Assange is the only media publisher and free speech advocate in the Western world who is in a situation that a UN body has characterized as arbitrary detention. It is a matter of public controversy how this situation should be understood. The circumstances of his case arguably raise issues about human rights and Press freedom, which are the subject of legitimate public debate. Such debate may even help to resolve them, which would itself be a public benefit.  4:23 AM - 14 Dec 2017

Lets make this go viral for Chuck Shumer  RLES E. SCHUMER an  WPnited States Senate i  WASHINGTON, DC 20510-3203  May 12, 2000  yew York 11756  rt  Thank you for contacting me to express your concems about the issue of illegal immigration in the United States. I believe it is imperative that we enforce and strengthen existing immigration laws to prevent illegal immigrants from entering this country.  Last year in the House of Representatives, I supported the Criminal Alien Deportation Involvement Act, which would have reduced the delay involved in the deportation of criminal aliens. In addition, I cosponsored the Immigration and Naturalization Service Restructuring Act (H.R. 4363). This legislation would have given the Immigration and Naturalization Services the resources to handle the responsibilities of border patrol and enforcement, and the traditional function of support services.  You can be certain that in the Senate, | will continue to fight for tougher measures to reduce the number of illegal immigrants entering this country. Again, thank you for taking the time to share your views about this important issue. If I may be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.  Sincerely,  Charles E. Schumer United States Senate

PRESS RELEASE  Statement on Mayor Pugh's Leave of Absence  BALTIMORE, MD. — Mayor Catherine E. Pugh has been battling pneumonia for the past few weeks. She has been advised by her physicians that she needs to take time to recover and focus on her health. At this time, with the Mayor’s health deteriorating, she feels as though she is unable to fulfill her obligations as Mayor of Baltimore City. To that end, Mayor Pugh will be taking an indefinite leave of absence to recuperate from this serious illness.  Article IV, Section 2 of the Baltimore City Charter states that “{[i]n case of, and during, sickness, temporary disqualification or necessary absence of the Mayor, the President of the City Council shall be ex officio Mayor of the City.”  In Mayor Pugh’s absence, City Council President Bernard C. “Jack” Young will take over the daily operations of City government as ex officio Mayor of Baltimore City.

NATIONAL ARCHIVES     THE STORY OF THE PERFUME  Archiviste celebrates the National Archives’ commitment to history, imbued with a distinct crackle of mylar and layer of parchment that invoke textual treasures, while the peppery notes of electricity reflect the mission of digitization and open access. With a drydown of sharp notes of vinegar syndrome and powdery red rot, each whiff will remind you of the importance of preserving history.  REVIEWS  I visited the National Archives in the eighth grade. ‘This scent makes me feel like I'm standing in front of the Constitution again for the first time!  ‘Asa researcher, I'm always looking for history-based scents. ‘This one is a keeper! Too bad this perfume is an April Fools joke.

I think it’s brave that you get up in the morning even if your soul is weary and your bones ache for a rest.  I think it’s brave that you keep on living even if you don’t know how to anymore.  I think it’s brave that you push away the waves rolling in every day and you decide to fight yet again.  I know there are days when you feel like giving up, but I think it’s brave that you never do.  ~ Lana Rafaela

Another source said farm- ers were now approaching KWS asking where they could sell quail eggs and the birds following a market glut. —  ‘Ms Muita said production nd marketing were not                    KWS's esponsibility but of the Ministry of Livestock and Export Council.  She took a swipe at the media for disparaging the business by teferring to it as a “pyramid scheme”,  A licence to rear quails costs Shi,500 annually,  However, the price of the birds and eggs has continued to plummet, with some farm- ers now at a loss following saturation in the market.  In December, a quail egg was fetching between Sh70 and Shi00 but it now sells for between Sh20 and Sh30.  A day-old chick now goes for Shi60 from Sh400.

Ratings & Reviews  ed  1. IMDb  Rate and review the show and each episode. Current rating is 7.7110. It's ok, but we should try to improve it.  2. Rotten Tomatoes  Rate and review the seasons. Current audience score overall is 91%, for season 1 it's 86% (4.3/5), for season 2 it's 95% (4,8/5), and for the Christmas. Special it's 90% (4/5). This could use a few more written reviews for season 2 and the Special.  3. Metacritic  Rate and review the show. Current user score for season 1 is 7.0/10, for season 2 it's 8.0/10, and for the Christmas Special it's tod because it needs more ratings to be counted. This needs overall improvement.  4.

To take words from a comic book solicit that are designed to drum up interest in what obstacles a character has to overcome in an upcoming story & try to twist them into this just shows these people have no understanding of how the business of comics (or film!) work.

InStyle  Part of the reason Larson took on the role of Marvel’s ultimate feminist icon, Captain Marvel, is due to the character’s own sense of humanity. “She didn’t apologize for herself,” Larson explains. “I felt like that was a really valuable trait, because she is incredibly flawed and makes a lot of mistakes ... and has to ask to atone for them, and  that is super valuable. She’s not ever shrinking herself down.”  It also linked back to her mission of filmmaking with a purpose. “The movie was the biggest and best opportunity I could have ever asked for,” Larson says. “It was, like, my superpower. This could be my form of activism: doing a film that can play all over the  world and be in more places than I can be physically.”

PT a AYU  Why is everyone, so angry, about everything, all of the time?  Fd) /TH 4 HS Questionlime
iE SPEAKEI       ‘Austin, TX, May 15, 2019 ~ Austin-based grassroots gun rights organization, Lone Star Gun Rights, has filed 4 lawsuit in Federal Court against Texas House Speaker, Dennis Bonnen, of House District 25 (Angleton/Lake Jackson), The organization is claiming that in his official capacity as both the Representative of District 25 and as ‘Speaker, Dennis Bonnen has silenced crities on his public Facebook page, where he constantly gives legistative updates tw his followers.  ‘At the beginning of April, news broke that Speaker Bonnen was proclaiming HB3S7 (also known as Constitutional Carry) “dead” after a grassroots organizer was utilizing campaign-style tacties to raise awareness about the bill being stalled in committee. Taking to Facebook on April 6", the Speaker stated that the various grassroots organizations “want anyone ~ including criminals ~to be able to carry a gun without a ficense,” giving the impression to anyone not familiar with the contents of HB3S7 that the bill would legalize the carrying of handguns by convicted felons. A couple of days following that post, the Speaker doubled down on this deliberate misstatement by saying on The Chad Hasty Show that Constitutional Carry was “an issue that would allow a etiminal the ability to carry a gun.”           As there is no official Speaker of the House Facebook page, and all official updates from the Speaker's Office are posted only on his campaign Facebook page, LSGR and several members left comments to voice their disapproval of the Speaker's actions. This resulted in an abundance of members, including those who operate the LSGR Facebook page, being banned from interacting on the Speaker's page. This also resulted in their comments being deleted, leaving ‘only the one side of the argument to be seen by the 15,321 Facebook users that follow the Speaker's page, as well as the countless number of people who do not,  Lone Star Gun Rights as an organization, along with two individual plaintiffs, ate suing Texas House Speaker Dennis Bonnen in Federal Court for 1" and 14" Amendment violations for silencing his critics in what senior Courts have concluded to be a public forum. The suit seeks an injunction against the Speaker to unban all Facebook users ‘who have been banned thus far, and reinforce the already established precedent that an elected official may not silence critics in-a public forum. No punitive damages are being sought; however, the plaintiffs are seeking reimbursement of legal fees,     Hitt  LSGR Contact: Derek Wills  Email: derck@lonestare.com ‘Website: hnips/ywwIsgrlive

He knows a hero when he sees one.  Too few characters out there, flying around like that, saving old girls like me. And Lord knows, kids like Henry need a hero. Courageous, self-sacrificing people.

And years later,  they'll tell how they stood in the rain  for hours just to get a glimpse - of the one who taught them how to hold on a second longer.

A refined palace with a swimming pool, once stood here. The sand only preserved its eastern wing, comprising a grand (dining?) complex:  a central hall (Tri um?) flanked by two small rooms on each side, all richly decorated, and provided with bathing and heating facilities. To the NE, a staircase led to the upper story, and the Upper Palace. A mikveh (Gewish ritual bath) and a bathhouse were  found next to it.

battle bygone  Cleveland, May.81—(P)—A. of, fists reminiscent of. a ‘baseball era, with George Moriarty, ee pene rey umpire, |  A tour Chicago x players beat Pelligerents, brought Amer- fean rosie —— here hurriedly  , tor: vestigation.  who in his playing days maintained a rough and tumble Yeputation and once trounced Ty Cobb, went down before superior numbers after knocking out Milton Gaston, Chicago pitcher, yesterday. Moriarty ‘was reported to have suf- fered a broken right hand and head injuries.  ‘The fight occurred after Cleveland  took both ends of a double-header, from the White Sox. Cleveland players. who witnessed the encoun~ ter declared the Chicago players _ started it, Manager Lou Fonseca of the visitors, himself a partici- pant, asserted that Moriarty took _the initiative Moriarty and the other umpire, Bill Dineen, refused to talk.  According to Cleveland players, Catcher Charlie Berry of the Sox followed Moriarty into the runway “to the club house, accusing him of “missing” a third strike on Earl Averill just before the Indian broke up the second game with a ninth- inning triple.  Berry challenged. Moriarty to Le tie Cleveland players said,  en Milt Gaston, Chicago pitcher, ‘advanced himself. The umpire felled Gaston, injuring his hand in doing so. Then Berry, Catcher Frank Grube and Fonseca rushed Moriarty, beating him until he was rescued by the Indidns.

Suspensions ranging from 90 days to life are possible for a physical attack on an  umpire. —_- ‘ Coach Tells Story  This is the version of the trouble provided by Coach Howard Shanks, Luke Sewell and Bruce Connatser of the Indians. :  As Berry followed the umpire into the runway, the three Cleve- land players urged Moriarty to hurry on, but he said:  “Don't hurry me, boys. I’m not afraid of what. these fellows will do.” Thereupon Berry challenged him to fight.  “Tl take the whole White Sox club, one at a time,” said Moriarty.  Here Gaston stepped in and said, “You might as well start.” Then came the knockout of Gaston, and the mellee started.  Fonseca insisted Moriarty issued the first challenge. “The tipoff,” Fonseca asserted, “is that he left the field through the players’ run- way toward the clubhouse, instead of going out to the umpires’ dress- ing room by the usual route.  “He spent the afternoon begging for trouble and he finally got it, but if he says the Chicago players were the first to issue a challenge to fight he’s lying. What they did do was accept his challenge, which he repeated several times,  “I intend to stick by my players in the trouble. There's nothing in the laws of baseball making it mandatory for ball players to ac- cept without a comeback any and all the abuse which umpires choose to shower them with.  “I regret rowdyism as much as anyone, but there are limits to what a player can be expected to endure without fighting. And Moriarty overstepped those limits.”  Other White Sox players declined  yice president, started ‘to comment.

FAQ  Why 100% clean and renewable and not just 100% renewable? Are you saying we won’t transition off fossil fuels?  Yes, we are Calling for a full transition off fossil fuels and zero greenhouse gases. Anyone who has read the resolution sees that we spell this out through a plan that calls for eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from every sector of the economy. Simply banning fossil fuels immediately won’t build the new economy to replace it - this is the plan to build that new economy and spells out how to do it technically. We do this through a huge mobilization to create the renewable energy economy as fast as possible. We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and  “power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero.

Having anxiety and depression is like being scared and tired at the same time. It's the fear of failure but no urge to be productive. It's wanting friends but hate socialising. It's wanting to be alone but not wanting to be lonely. It's caring about everything then caring about nothing. It's feeling everything at once then feeling paralysingly numb.

CCHIEE FINANCIAL OFFICER  JIMMY PATRONIS  STATE OF FLORIDA  March 5, 2019  Michelle R. Suskauer President of the Florida Bar 651 E. Jefferson Street Tallahassee, FL 32399-2300  President Suskauer:  As an advocate for Floridians across our state, I appreciate that the Florida Bar’s core mission is to “..,ensure the highest standards of legal professionalism in Florida; and protect the public by prosecuting unethical attomeys...” I know ensuring the integrity and highest standards of professional conduct of legal practitioners is of the upmost importance to your organization.  That is why I wanted to bring to your attention troubling statistics impacting the affordability of insurance for families that directly involve Florida attorneys     Assignment of benefits (AOB) lawsuits, skyrocketed in just four years. A conceming partnership is taking place in our state: questionable contractors and unscrupulous attorneys are teaming up to game the system originally intended to empower and protect consumers. This unethical business model impacts every Floridian. The most shocking partis that there are a select number of law firms manipulating the system for their own gain. AOB lawsuits increase insurance rates and threaten our state’s good financial standing. When lawsuits are out of control, consumers are always on the losing end,  My office receives service of process information on behalf of insurance companies, and based on that data, it appears certain law firms are working in concert with contractors to exploit AOB provisions by inflating costs for unmerited payouts. Evidence suggests these law firms are filing suit for the sole purpose of weaponizing the one-way attorney fee provision. Since the state’s legal environment regarding AOB is so friendly to plaintiff's attomeys, we are concemed that many firms are robo-signing complaints without performing necessary due diligence.     Given the sheer number of AOB cases being pumped out, if left unchecked these activities threaten to have the same outcome as when certain firms took advantage of the mortgage foreclosure crisis for profit. We cannot control natural disasters, so I’m calling on the  Florida Bar to help solve this manmade one by coming to the table to help address this crisis. My office stands ready to assist with any questions you may have. I look forward to hearing your findings.  Sincerely,      jef Financial Officer  DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES THE CAPITOL, TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA, 32599-0301 » (850) 413-2850 FAX (850) 413.2950
& The Courier-Mail  Frday 8 March 2019  ert om  Joyce poised to reclaim Nats leadership from lacklustre McCormack  DEPUTY Prime Minister Michael McCormack. has lost the confidence of the majority of Nationals, who are asking the embattled leader to resign or face a spill on the eve of the election.  Red-hot frustration is now building into a “political Sophie's Choice” for Nationals,  who fear moving on Mr McCormack after  the election will be too late, especially for Queensland MPs.  A number of MPs and senators who voted for Mr McCormack last year have now abandoned him for his predecessor Barnaby Joyce.  Some believe they cannot wait to roll Mr McCormack after the next election because too many seats are at risk

What is bipolar disorder?  Bipolar disorder is another mental illness that affects mood. With bipolar disorder, people experience episodes of depression and episodes of mania. An episode of depression in bipolar disorder is the same as other types of depression. Mania is an unusually high mood for the person. People may feel like their thoughts are racing and may feel hyperactive. They may feel unrealistically confident, happy, or very powerful. Many people don’t sleep much when they experience mania. They may act without thinking and do risky things they wouldn't normally do.

On Feb.1992, the USS Baton Rouge submarine, was lurking in the shallow waters near the Russian port of Murmansk.  The exact nature of the Baton Rouge’s espionage activities has never been clarified.     The Russian submarine, the B-276 Kostroma, had attempted to surface underneath the Baton Rouge. The Kostroma’s conning tower had impacted the belly of the American ship. The Baton Rouge was decommissioned. The Kostroma, however, was repaired and put back to sea. Russian sailors have painted a kill marking on its conning tower to commemorate the “defeat” of the Baton Rouge.

The helicopter was in the air for 11 minutes  The helicopter that crashed into a Manhattan building was only in the air for 11 minutes, Officials said.  "At approximately 1:32 this afternoon, the helicopter took off at the 34th Street heliport and about 11 minutes later crashed across the street from where we are now," Police Commissioner James O'Neill said at a news conference.  O'Neill said the first 911 calls came in at 1:43 p.m. ET and reported a crash and a fire on top of a 54-story office building on 7th Avenue.

TWELVE  Apologizing when you have hurt someone who really matters to you takes nothing away from you. Even if it was unintentional, it’s so easy to just apologize and move on. Try not to say “I’m sorry, but...” and make excuses for yourself. Learn how to make a sincere apology, and you can avoid breaking down the trust in your  friendships and relationships.

Step Three: Justify the ‘SPECIAL COUNSEL’ and MILLIONS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS SPENT as necessary to protect the public and our election process against an imaginary, made-up, non-existent threat (which really is) designed to protect the illegal activities of many elected officials.  Step Four: Open 'new' Fake & False investigations as CHAIRMAN of the House Intel Comm to retain disinformation campaign designed to keep liberal/D Americans onboard to regain POWER & PREVENT prosecution - Executive Time!

Do you have a Conservative MP?  Up until now they have all had to toe the party line as they were on the Government payroll. Tomorrow is a free vote on stopping No Deal.  Please urgently e-mail your MP and ask them to vote against No Deal so we can stop this. Point out the disastrous economic effects etc. Then ask them to support an extension and then to revoke ASO, or at least to back a people vote.  Lets see if we can fill up their inboxes overnight.  #StopBrexit

| also see the reoccurring pattern of graphic violence being brought up, and it can be awful at times - but most of our Tampa site consist of people of color. The most draining thing for the majority of us is the extreme amount of hate speech we see very day. There is so much of it there is even a specific queue for it. It's extremely depressing, and most of our on site "therapist" are older white people who are very out of touch with current times.  Graphic violence might be 5% of what we see, but at least 60% of my job consists of looking over hate speech and seeing how much people hate people of color and LGBT people.

“Tt was respect,” Pochettino said. “Respect the people, respect the opponent. They’re not going to have many chances to see Harry Kane play here in a competition like the FA Cup. For different reasons I decided to make a change and put Kane on the pitch but one of them is that it’s important to show respect to the people here so they could see Harry Kane, who is an icon in English football. It is difficult in that division to see it. It was important to see him in action.”

Pelosi Statement on Trump Speech  JANUARY 10, 2010  San Francisco — Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued this statement in advance of the President's address:  "Democrats were hopeful that the President was finally willing to re-open government and proceed with a much-needed discussion to protect the border.  “Unfortunately, initial reports meke clear that his proposal is e compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total, do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people's lives. it is unlikely that any one of these provisions alone would pass the House, and taken together, they are a non-starter. For one thing, this proposal does not include the permanent solution for the Dreamers and TPS recipients that our country needs and supports  “Democrats support smart, effective border security solutions  © Increased infrastructure investments at our ports of entry including additional ports and roads;  * Advanced technology to scan for drugs, weapons and contraband where the vast majority of drugs come in to our country and advanced technology to detect unauthorized crossings;  © More customs personnel including filling the more than 3,000 customs and border patrol vacancies; and  © More immigration judges.  "Next week, Democrats will pass @ package of six bills agreed to by House and Senate negotiators and other legislation to re-open government so that we can fully negotiate on border security proposals.  "The President must sign these bills to re-open government immediately and stop holding the American people hostage with this senseless shutdown. Each day he prolongs this needless crisis, Coast Guardsmen, FBI agents, border patrol officers, TSA agents, and hundreds of thousands more workers are forced to live without knowing how they can feed their families or pay their bills.  “The President has taken pride in shutting down government. Now, he must take action to open up government.”

The expertise field has come a long way since the early works of de Groot (1965) and Chase and Simon (1973). Since then, this inquiry has expanded into the areas of music, science, technology, sport, academia and art. Despite the vast amount of research to date, the capability of study methodologies to truly capture the nature of expertise remains questionable. Some considerations include (i) the individual bias in the retrospective recall of developmental activities, (ii) the ability to develop ecologically valid tasks, and (iii) difficulties capturing the influence of confounding factors on expertise. This article proposes that expertise research in electronic sports (esports) presents an opportunity to overcome some of these considerations. Esports involves individuals or teams of players that compete in video game competitions via human-computer interaction. Advantages of applying the expert performance approach in esports include (i) developmental activities are objectively tracked and automatically logged online, (ii) the constraints of representative tasks correspond with the real-world environment of esports performance, and (iii) expertise has emerged without the influence of guided systematic training environments. Therefore, this article argues that esports research provides an ideal opportunity to further advance research on the development and assessment of human expertise.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Seven killed in bombing of Save the Children-supported hospital in Yemen  SANA’A, YEMEN (March 26)—Four children were among seven people killed today when a hospital supported by Save the Children in Yemen was hit by an airstrike. Two other adults are unaccounted for.  Amissile struck a petrol station near the entrance to Kitaf rural hospital, about 100km from the city of Saada in the northwest of the country, at 9.30am.  The hospital had been open for only half an hour and many patients and staff were arriving on a busy morning. They included a health worker who died along with their two children.  Also among the dead were two other children and a security guard. In addition to those killed and missing, a further eight people were wounded in the attack.  The missile was said to have landed within 50 meters of the facility's main building on the fourth anniversary of the escalation of conflict in Yemen.  Save the Children, which reported earlier this week that 37 children a month had been killed or injured by foreign bombs in the last year, demanded an urgent investigation into the latest atrocity.  Kevin Watkins, CEO of Save the Children, who has visited Save the Children health facilities in Yemen, said:  “We are shocked and appalled by this outrageous attack. Innocent children and health workers have lost their lives in what appears to been an indiscriminate attack on a hospital in a densely populated civilian area. Attacks like these are a breach of international law.  “This hospital is just one of the many Save the Children support across Yemen, delivering life-saving aid to children living in what is the worst place on earth to be a child. These children have the right to be safe in their hospitals, schools and homes. But time after time, we see a complete disregard by all warring parties in Yemen for the basic rules of war. Children must be protected. We must Stop this War on Children.”  Save the Children, which covers some of the staff costs at the hospital, is calling for an immediate suspension of arms sales to warring parties in Yemen, where children continue to be killed and maimed indiscriminately.  It is also calling for full diplomatic pressure to be applied to all parties in the conflict to resolve it through consultation and negotiation, and for those who commit violations of international law to be held to account.

CUBS NAME INF ROBEL GARCIA, RHP TYSON MILLER  MINOR LEAGUE PLAYER, PITCHER OF THE MONTH FOR APRIL ‘Monpay, May 6, 2019  CHICAGO - The Chicago Cubs today named Double-A Tennessee infielder Robel Garcia and right-handed pitcher Tyson Miller the organization's minor league player and pitcher of the month for April, respectively.  Garcia, 26, batted .327 (18-for-55) with five doubles, five homers, six walks and 20 RBI in 15 games in April with the Smokies. He recorded a season-high three hits on Opening Day, April 4 vs. Mississippi, and registered eight games with at least two RBI in the month, Through 19 games this season, the switch-hitter has batted .328 (22-for-67) with five doubles, six homers, 25 RBI and a .418 OBP. Despite missing time on the injured list with a left hamstring strain from April 5-15, he leads the Southern League in RBI, OBP, slugging (.672) and OPS (1.089), while ranking tied for third in homers and fifth in batting average.     Signed by the Cubs as a minor league free agent, October 31, 2018, Garcia is in his first season of professional baseball in the United States since being released by Cleveland in March of 2014. Garcia played in the Italian Baseball League for UnipolSai Bologna in 2018, helping the club to a league championship. A native of the Dominican Republic, Garcia originally signed with Cleveland as a non-drafted free agent, February 2, 2010.  Miller, 23, went 1-1 with a 1.42 ERA (3 ER/19.0 IP) in four April starts, and has a 1.07 ERA (3 ER/25.1 IP) in five total starts this season. The right-handed pitcher has limited ‘opponents to a .138 average (12-for-87) and has posted a 0.75 WHIP, striking out 25 batters and walking just seven. In his last start, May 1 vs. Jackson, he retired his first 18 batters faced as he finished with 6.1-scoreless innings and a season-high nine strikeouts. Miller’s 1.07 ERA ranks third in the Southern League, while his .138 opponent batting average and 0.75 WHIP both rank second.  Selected by the Cubs in the fourth round of the 2016 draft out of California Baptist University, Miller is 18-18 with a 3.67 ERA (123 ER/301.2 IP) in 64-career games, including 53 starts. He spent all of last season with Single-A Myrtle Beach, going 9-9 with a 3.54 ERA (50 ER/127.0 IP), and this season marks his first experience at the Double-A level.

Dear Sarfraz Ahmed,  You get paid half a million every month as part of your central contract, you get paid separately as your daily match fees, you get millions in sponsorship deals, not to forget the money you mint through PSL and other leagues, so before you carry your sorry EI face with this type of acting, you have an option to retire and get the| from the side! No body is forcing you to play! If you cannot perform then quit but stop playing with the nation and our feelings!  Stop portraying this image that you are sorry! You have convincingly lost 11 straight matches but you haven't dropped 1 match fees of yours so please dont pretend you are sorry because you ain't!

BEST ALBUMS OF 2019 (SO FARI)  Map of the Soul: Persona, BTS  BTS took their music to mythical proportions with the release of Map of the Soul: Persona. The album debuted at No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200, making BTS the first group since The Beatles to have three No. 1 albums in less than a year. (If that doesn't speak to the impact of BTS’ music and message, nothing will.) A joyride from start to finish, Personas packed with summertime anthems, R&B and hip-hop tunes. Just like The Beatles 55 years ago, BTS are taking the world by storm and  cementing themselves as one of the biggest pop groups of all-time, ~ Emlyn Travis

From: Doug <doug@ontariope.com>     Subject: RE: Autism Assurance  Hello  Thank you so much for your email. We appreciate you taking the time to write to us.  An Ontario PC Government will maintain the Ontario Autism Program, but we will enhance it by adding $100 million in the 2018-19 fiscal year. This is an increase of $38 million from the Liberal’s 2018 budget promise This money will be used to help increase the number of children accessing services and reduce delays for families to get access to these services  In addition, we will review how to implement a province-wide approval of autism service dogs in schools across the province — something which our candidate Amy Fee has fought for after her child's service dog was rejected from a Kitchener-Weaterloo area school.  Lastly, our childcare rebate includes an increased amount to claim against if a child has severe mental or physical disabilities. While this does not apply to all children with autism, it would apply to children with severe autism. They can claim against $11,000 of expenses, instead of $9,000 of expenses — meaning the maximum they can receive for a rebate is $8,250  Ifyou have any further questions, please feel free to contact our team anytime. Please follow us on Facebook, ‘Twitter, and Instagram to stay in touch with us and please stay tuned to further announcements as our platform is rolled out. Help is on the way.  Thank you,  Team Doug Ford

ATRFC #SWA,
MORNING REPORT EXCLUSIVE: President Trump’s reelection team is staffing up its press operation as it moves toward a formal campaign launch in mid-June. The campaign added Sarah Matthews and Daniel Bucheli as deputy press secretaries. Matthews worked for the House Energy and Commerce Committee and Bucheli served in Rep. Ross Spano’s (R-Fla.) office. Bucheli will be a campaign liaison with Spanish- language media. Andrew Clark, formerly with the National Association of Manufacturers, will be the campaign’s director of rapid response. All three start today.  Additionally, Francis Brennan is leaving his role as co-founder of the NTK Network to become director of strategic response and to oversee the Trump campaign’s war room. He will join the campaign later this month.

Clearly, the mere use of encryption cannot be ch considered a criminal behaviour. The charges are the equivalent of saying that because one Privacy criminal used WhatsApp, all users of WhatsApp International are also criminals. All 1.2 billion of them.  BEING ARRESTED FOR USING ENCRYPTION              LIKE BEING ARRESTED FOR LOCKING YOUR FRONT DOOR OR OWNING A SAFE.     Those arrested solely for the use of encryption should be immediately released and have the charges dropped.     medium.com/@privacyint/encryption-at-the-centre-of-mass-arrests-one-year-on-from-turkeys-failed-coup-e6ecd0ef77c9

A Civil Service Source Icanreveal Whitehall        Brexit plan: stop it dead iat  he four core values of the civil service are honesty, integrity, impartiality ‘and objectivity. Before joining the ‘organisation I had believed, naively that these values would be upheld very quickly came ation to Brexit, could be further from the           ‘unconditional tolearn that, in nothin,         Anonymous for fear ofthe backlash Lwould  | receive at my place of work, However, Tean  reveal that Lam a senior policy professional  ‘within the civil service and work closely with  | numerous governmental departments.  | There area number of extremely dangerous myths regarding civil servants that Imust  dispel because of the impact they are having on.  | the Brexit process.  Myth I: the civil service is independent. T he civil service was founded on the pillars of political neutrality. ensure that their own not affect their work. accept those from all political leanings and points of view.  Ithas become clear to me that the vast  majority of civil servants support “remain”. From my own observations I would estimate: this number to be well over 90%. This is. worrying in itself and far from representative of ‘the 52% of the population who voted for Brexit. ‘Most horrifying, however, is the sheer disdain and utter contempt that my colleagues display towards people who voted to leave. I have lost count of the number of insulting and derogatory terms that are used in my own  jent and elsewhere to refer to the 17.4 people who voted for Brexit: “racist”, “stupid”, “uneducated”. AntiBrexitjokes and snide remarks are dropped casually into everyday office conversations,  Jive in fear that my colleagues will discover through astip of my tongue that lama Brexiteer, Were this to happen, I genuinely believe that most would refuse to talk tome              again and that I might even lose my job. ‘This entire culture creates a Ing cloud of all areas of Iservice. 1 first-hand civil servants doing everything within their power, subtly and under the _| surface, to frustrate Brexitand: at every ty. This can onl undermine our efforts to be in the strongest position, -on leaving the EU.  ; civil servants are experts in their stance think the individuals  Far from impartial, the civil service  h      making decisions that affect our entire nation  would have some level of skill or experience, If  or example, Lnow of one ding our     only thatwere true stanxhilone “expert” preparations for imagine my Aisbeliet when I discovered none ofits members had worked on anything remorely, related to the EU bet  Invfact Thave discovered vast majority of “experts” within the ch service have no expertise whatsoever: | cases the “portfolio” thatyou ‘you join the service is dictated by the o by your predecessor, Asa result you have new servants inheriting politically sensitive and highly important work without the faintest clue about what they are dealing with,  ivilservants who are seriously ‘underperforming will usually have anew job title and position created for them somewhere ‘else in the organisation instead of being sacked ‘or performance-managed = they become ‘someone else's problem then, Given the influence that civil servants are exerting over the Brexit process, this is truly concerning.  Myth 3: the civilservice does not engage in scaremongering. had hoped that ell ‘servants, even in times of crisis, would be able to remain calm and level-headed in pursult of ensuring the best outcomes for our country. ‘And yet itis not uncommon for me to receive emails from colleagues promoting Brexit scare stories that are nothing more than lies and speculation.  Recently, things have become so panicked that various “Brexit contingency” plans have been set up throughout the organisation. This {s to prepare for the “national public transport breakdown”, “surge in criminality” and “widespread public unrest” that is going to follow March 29.  “These plans also involve collecting the personal details of certain civil servants to put in place a 24-hour on-call rota for the  Mp: & ae Anti-Brexitjokes are droppedinto office conversations                                                              avily biased against leaving     “emergency” tl scaremonge’ civil  hat is looming. This created and whipped up by marked impact on the Confidence and wellbeing of ordinary citizens, For example, one acquaintance of mines 80 | terrified by the speculative threats put out by the civil service that they have already started. tostockpile large quantities of thelr medication, This needs to stop. ‘Myth 4: ininisters are in charge. When Lwas outside the civil service loo in, Lalways believed that civil servi were there simply to audvise their ministers, who, as elected representatives of the people, would make the tllinate decision, However, Have come to realise that ministers are often mere puppets with civil servants pulling ferociously at their strings. The level of bureaucracy is. unimaginable, In my experience: ntary briefings go through ~ ata minimum ~ five stages of internal clearance, with crucial information being amended or deleted at every stage on the whim of that individual civil servant,  ‘The power and competence of our ministers 1s, 'matraid, a facade. They are nothing more than a megaphone for the views of biased civil servants who lurk behind them in the shadows  Tama long-standing believer in and supporter ofthe “leave” campaign. Not so long ‘ago we celebrated the 800th anniversary of  ‘Magna Carta. The UK has been built on the pillars of democracy and we have the greatest Tegal system in the world.

Quote from Brendan McPhillips, lowa State Director, Pete for America:  “Pete’s message of generational change is resonating in lowa. Since April, we've seen a 20 times increase in volunteers in lowa. And we’re empowering those volunteers to organize their friends, neighbors, and communities to support Pete. The debate watch parties are putting this organic organizing work on display — with watch parties being led and organized by volunteers. With a bolstered organizing team, we'll continue to center our volunteers and help resource, train, and channel their energy into deep organizing work in every precinct in lowa.”

DAY 46: PRAYER FOR FULFILLMENT OF PROPHECIES Prophesies are conditional        "If my people”. We have our parts to play.  Prophecy for the International Scene  "And it shall come to pass afterward, that | will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and  your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:  And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will | pour out my spirit. And | will  shewwonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. The sun shall be turned  into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come. And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem  shall be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the remnant whom the LORD shall call.” Joe! 2:28-32  Sing this song “All over the world, the Spirit is moving. All over the world, as the prophet said, it should be.  All over the world, there is a mighty revelation of the glory of the Lord, as the water covers the sea.”  1. Pray that the Spirit of the lord will come mightily come to convict the righteous of his righteousness and bring judgments upon the wicked people and nations.  Individuals: “It is of the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because His compassions fail They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness".  Lam, 3:22-231.  Pray according to Psa. 147:11, That the mercies of the Lord will carry you throughout this year, years to come and even till eternity.     not.  For RCCG: PRAYERS FOR DIVINE INSURANCE: Read Psalm 91: And pray every verse of this chapter for your protection and your family, the Church of God, throughout this year and beyond. Pray for the grace to walk in righteousness, for in righteousness shall ye be established.  1. Say Father! Please, insure my life and family throughout 2019.  2, Father! Please keep my family and | from excruciating heat of affliction and severe evil. Please hide  me under the shadow of Your power in the name of Jesus.  3. Say Father! Throughout 2019, please rescue me, protect me, set me on a high place, answer me  when | call, deliver me from distress, honor me, grant me long life and show me Your salvation in the  name of Jesus.  @@OO eTheHGservice | |

STATEMENT FROM “RIVERDALE” EXECUTIVE PRODUCERS GREG BERLANTI, ROBERTO AGUIRRE- SACASA, SARAH SCHECHTER AND JON GOLDWATER; WARNER BROS. TELEVISION; AND THE CW  “We are deeply saddened to learn today about the passing of Luke Perry. A beloved member of  the Riverdale, Warner Bros. and CW family, Luke was everything you would hope he would be: an incredibly caring, consummate professional with a giant heart, and a true friend to all. A father figure and mentor to the show’s young cast, Luke was incredibly generous, and he infused the set with love and kindness. Our thoughts are with Luke's family during this most difficult time.”

Lets make this go viral for Chuck Shumer  RLES E ‘SCHUMER 00 Pnited States Senate ®  WASHINGTON, DC 20510-3203      May 12, 2000  York 11756  A  ‘Thank you for contacting me to express your concems about the issue of illegal immigration in the United States. I believe it is imperative that we enforce and strengthen existing immigration laws to prevent illegal immigrants from entering this country.  Last year in the House of Representatives, I supported the Criminal Alien Deportation Involvement Act, which would have reduced the delay involved in the deportation of criminal aliens. In addition, I cosponsored the Immigration and Naturalization Service Restructuring Act (H.R. 4363). This legislation would have given the Immigration and Naturalization Services the resources to handle the responsibilities of border patrol and enforcement, and the traditional function of support services.  You can be certain that in the Senate, I will continue to fight for tougher measures to reduce the number of illegal immigrants entering this country. Again, thank you for taking the time to share your views about this important issue. If I may be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.  Sincerely,  Charles E. Schumer United States Senate

I encourage Socialist Democrats and their radical news media allies to cleanse their souls and atone for their sins by apologizing to the American people for the fraud and scam they committed in an effort to delegitimize the 2016 election and enhance their own power grab and election prospects. The Socialist Democrats’ scam and fraud has undermined our republic. It has been divisive to the point some Americans have been driven to violence out of hatred for President Trump. It’s shameful  what they have done to America.

Before the summer, is there any non-Brexit business that must be taken on the floor of the Commons, to help fill the legislative gap?  The only item we can think of so far is the approval of remaining estimates (of government spending).  To be approved under the procedures normally used for estimates, all the year’s remaining estimates must be approved by 5 August.  The process comprises debates and votes on selected estimates on ‘estimates days’, on motions that may be amended only to reduce the amount of spending authorised; a vote on an unamendable ‘roll-up’ motion for all remaining estimates; and passage of the Supply and Appropriation (Main Estimates) Bill, which may not be amended and thus has no committee stage.

Scott Morrison positively oozing respect       Scott Morrison had no qualms about refusing to allow Melissa McIntosh, Liberal candidate for Lindsay, to answer a question put to her by the media. When she turned to address the question, he made a grab for her arm. After she submissively fell in behind, he uttered a dismissive 'C'mon' that would have raised the hackles of a border collie.

1" version:  2” version:  3 Version:  4° Version:  In Wade's complaint, he claims that on the first night he stayed at Neverland, Wade, his sister and Jackson share a bed. Wade claims that on the second night, his sister opted to sleep on the upper level. This is when Wade claims Jackson first molested him.  In Wades book draft that he was shopping in late 2012/early 2013 (as uncovered in the process of discovery), Wade claims that he wasn't molested during the first two nights. He claims it started when his family left him alone at Neverland the following week.  In Wades 2016 deposition, he was asked if his account of the first two nights at Neverland as per his book draft was consistent with his memory now. Wade replied: “Yeah, | don't really remember’.  On May 26, 2018, after his civil claim and civil lawsuit was firmly tossed out of court, Wade gives an interview with Inside Addition to discuss his allegations. He says: “Every time we were together, it happened. There was no night that went by that | was

Natural Resources Oral Questions  June 18th, 2014 / 2:30 p.m.     Justin Trudeau Papineau, QC  Mr. Speaker, yesterday, going against the tide, the Prime Minister approved the northern gateway pipeline project. Environmental considerations and the opinion of aboriginal communities were not taken into account. Not only that, but the risk to British Columbia's coastal economy is tremendous. It is not a good location for a pipeline. Will this Prime Minister finally listen to the public and reverse his decision to approve this project?

BHANSALI TO REUNITE WITH SALMAN ON BIRTHDAY  Over a decade after their last collaboration, director to announce his next with Khan tomorrow  MOHAR BASU. mohar.basu@mid-day.com  IT was over six months ago that Sanjay Leela Bhansali had taken to his Instagram handle to confirm that he was reuniting with his fa- vourite star, Salman Khan, for a film. While the post was enough to send fans intoa tizzy, the filmmaker has been tight-lipped on the project. ever since, presumably waiting for the perfect opportunity to make the announcement. Now, mid-day has learnt that Bhansali will raise the curtain on the Khan-starrer tomor- row on the occasion of his birthday.  Asource reveals, “Over a year af- ter Padmaavat hit theatres, Bhansa liis ready to announce his next pro- ject. Unlike his last two outings that were period dramas, this film will be set in the current day and age. What makes it all the more special is that it marks his reunion with Sal- man after 12 years since Saawariya (2007). The two were in talks over the past few months and are excit- ed to team up again. They will soon zero in on the leading lady.”  Khan holds a special place in Bhansali’s life — the superstar was part of the filmmaker’s debut vehi- cle, Khamoshi (1996). The two then went on to deliver a runaway hit in Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (1999).                                                                                                           Bhansali Although the duo had a falling out in 2010 over Guzaarish, they buried the hatch- et in 2017. Since then, cinephiles have been wait- ing with bated breath for the duo toweave their magic on celluloid.  While reports suggested that the Khan-starrer is titled Inshallah, the source says that it is the working title. “The romance drama will go on floors by the year-end and will be shot in Mumbai. While Salman wraps up Bharat and a large chunk of Dabangg 3, Bhansali will focus on the film’s pre-production.”

Most of you know that our fandom got nominated for Best Fan Army.  And most of us are not happy about it  Alot decided to not vote and don't give it anymore clout.  This is totally fine.  BUT.  Throughout the day | saw a lot ARMY sending unnecessary  negative comments against people who support the voting. including various radio stations.  I don't know why you do this. | don't know if you don't think much about consequences  But you should know that these comments are NOT helping it's even the opposite  Especially in the US the radio is important. And we have some stations helping us  But what do | see today? Some are really sending supporting radio stations negative tweets just because they tweet about the iHeart Fan Army voting?  You can think what you want about this voting It's totally fine if you don't vote.  But please IGNORE it then completely and don't destroy the work of ARMY's to get BTS into the radio.  hope this will reach a lot of you. And I hope that (if you're one of the people who left negative comments) you delete these tweets

“As was the case with workers’ rights, the civil rights movement, the women’s movement, the gay rights movement and the environmental movement, the only way transformational legislation like Medicare for All passes is when millions of people stand up and demand it. And we're making progress in that fight every single day  In terms of Medicare for All, before we even get to the issue of the filibuster, we need 51 senators who are prepared to do what polls show that rank and file Democrats want -- and that is a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system. Currently, only 15 out of 47 Democrats have publicly stated their support for that legislation, and that has got to change. In my view, Democratic elected officials and candidates should do what graskroots Democrats want them to do.  Once we have, and I believe it will be sooner than later, a Democratic majority who are prepared to vote for Medicare for All in the House and Senate, we will pass it. In the Senate we must enact real filibuster reform, including the return to requiring a talking filibuster. It is not right that one Senator can grind the entire process to a halt.  Further, I would remind everyone that the budget reconciliation process, with 51 votes, has been used time and time again to pass major pieces of legislation and that under our Constitution and the rules of the Senate, itis the vice president who determines what is and is not permissible under budget reconciliation.

Included is some information about how your ticket package works:  ¢ Season Ticket prices for the upcoming season will range from $35 to $402 per game.  ¢ The overall average price is increasing by $1.85 per seat per game (2.11%), from $87.71 to $89.56.  ¢ There are price reductions (ranging from $8 to $22 per seat per game) on 7,700 seats, but most fans will see a small increase that varies by seating area.  ¢ We will continue to offer interest-free, extended payment plan options for your convenience through our new Easy Renew program. Some restrictions apply, see Terms and Conditions for more details.  View seating chart with 2019 pricing.  With these figures in mind, Bills season tickets continue to be one of the best values in the NEL. Based on the 2018 NFL Fan Cost Index compiled by Team Marketing Report, our average regular season ticket price is the second lowest in the NFL. Your package still grants you access to membership benefits like Bills Bucks and discounts on single game ticket prices.  There is much to be excited for in 2019 and beyond — the organization has star-caliber talent at key positions, a top 10 draft pick, and we recently commissioned a study to measure new stadium and/or renovation options. There are exciting new heights in this team’s future, and we can’t wait to have you with us to experience them.  Please contact your account representative if you have any questions about the renewal process.     Thank you again for your valued support.  Sincerely,  nia B Ceo  Chris Colleary Vice President of Ticket Sales & Service

Ana Navarro @ @ananavarro  Must Watch: Native-American elder taunted by racist MAGA-hat wearing teens, speaks and cries for America, the country he defended and sacrificed and wore the uniform for. It is people like Nathan Phillips who make America great.
