BROOKS KOEPKA  WINNER OF THE 101ST PGA CHAMPIONSHIP


Salman Khan                                            SALMAN DONATES GYM EQUIPMENT TO COLLEGE  alman Khan has always believed in staying fit. So much so that he has always inculcated the habit of gymming and working out among all his close associates. Under his charity Being Human, the superstar also comes up with several competent methods to maintain a healthier lifestyle. Like, over a year ago, he introduced e-cycles to save up on resources and promote a       pollution-free environment. Now, the Race 3 actor has decided to donate his gym equipment to Khalsa College to promote fitness among their students, mostly the youth. GS Bajwa, Chairman of the college met the Dabangg hero and decided that all the modern gym gear that he donates, will be set up in the college gymkhana, with free access given to all students. Now, that’s what you call working for a good cause!

Fangirling strikes me again...Maymay Entrata and Edward Barber, much known as “MayWard".  MAYWARD is magic. The charisma of MayWard is truly awesome. This is again another loveteam that is bringing new wave of fanaticism...the authenticity is real. Humility and Faith in God radiates in them. Edward is the wind beneath Maymay’s wings while Maymay is Edward's angel in disguise.  My fangirling makes me always young at heart...sabi nga lakas maka-bagets.

The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.  This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump - helped along by Aras and Emin.

EMBATTLED Health Minister Sussan Ley is again under fire today after  revelations she purchased her Gold Coast apartment from a Liberal Party donor, just months after his company received a $110,000 grant.  Education Department contract documents reveal that Children First Learning Centres, owned by Liberal Party donor Martin C orkery, received a staff taining grant in November 2014 when Ms Ley was assistant Education Minister, the Gold Coast Bulletin reports.  Six months later she bought his luxury apartment for $795,000 — $35,000 less than Mr Corkey paid for it nine years earlier. Mr Corkey has denied he had any direct contact with Ms Ley before she purchased the property.

There was no player in college basketball more efficient in the post than Williamson. That’s not an exaggeration, and it honestly wasn’t particularly close. On his 77 post-ups this season, Williamson scored at prodigious 1.31 points-per-possession clip. Among other players with at least 50 post-up possessions this season, second place was Tyson Ward at North Dakota State at just 1.18 points per possession. The 0.13 points-per-possession difference

Mr Williamson believes the release of the report will prove the weakness of the case against him. Yesterday  the former director of public     prosecutions said the leak, over allowing Chinese firm Huawei access to help build the 5G network, amounted to a breach of the Official Secrets ‘Act and therefore should be referred to police, though Downing Street insisted the matter was considered closed.

Our broken health care system costs too much, is unsustainable, inefficient, unequal and unjust.  No one living in the richest country in the world should die or go bankrupt  because they can’t afford quality care. We need Medicare for All.”  -Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ)

Female speakers were more likely to be introduced by first name only (17% vs. 3%, p < 0.001). Males were less likely to use a professional address when introducing female speakers compared to male speakers (53% vs. 80%, p < 0.01). No gender differences in professional address were observed for female introducers (p = 0.13). Male introducers were more likely to address female speakers by first name only compared to female introducers (24% vs. 7%, p < 0.01). In a multivariable regression including gender, race, degree, and academic rank, male speakers were more likely to receive a professional address compared to female speakers (OR: 2.67, 95%CI: 1.81-3.94, p < 0.01). Black speakers of both genders were less likely to receive a professional address compared to NHW (OR: 0.10, 95%CI: 0.01-0.53, p < 0.01). Female gender was a predictor for a non- professional form of address (first name only) (OR: 9.50, 95%CI: 4.38-20.62, p < 0.01).

Nancy Pelosi is asking for public support for the House Democrats’ first bill. H.R.1 would create automatic voter registration, require paper ballots,  reduce partisan gerrymandering, limit big money in politics, require political groups to disclose donors, bar Congress members from serving on corporate boards and require presidents to disclose their tax returns.  SHARE TO SUPPORT IT!

“T intend to destroy segregation by positive and embracing methods,” Murray wrote in the magazine Common Ground when she was 35 years old. “When my brothers try to draw a circle to exclude me, I shall draw a larger circle to include them. Where they speak out for the privileges of a puny group, I shall shout for the rights of all mankind.”

[Example 1]  Planned Parenthood  $1.5 billion provided in taxpayer funding over 3- year period.  [Case 1]  PP spent $30 million [disclosed - real estimates close to $65 million] in taxpayer subsidies to influence the outcome of the 2018 midterm elections.  [Conclusion]  Should it be legal for a taxpayer [D+R+1] funded organization to donate massive amounts of money to the D party in an effort to sway an election?

If you’ve lost someone to war or conflict, every day is a kind of Memorial Day.  For the rest of us, once a year we are called upon to actively honor the sacrifice of our uniformed men and women who’ve died in service to our nation.  People have a “tendency ... to forget the purpose of Memorial Day and make it a day for games, races and revelry, instead of a day of memory and tears.”*  No, this is not a recent tweet or a pithy social media caption. It was uttered by a veteran in 1913, who felt the meaningfulness of Memorial Day was slipping through the American conscience.  While the nuances of Memorial Day are debated in the historical community, the most important takeaway is that its origins are in the Civil War.

‘Ashwini Sawant/DNA  Parineeti Chopra  f  Cay                  4  ‘KESARIIS  Deepali Singh  ike her Kesari co-star Akshay Kumar, Parineeti Chopra, too, is a morning person. The earli- er, the better. The actress believes she is raring to go, thanks to morning vibes. “Right now, I am dependent on my team, co-stars and shoot timings ete, but if things were left to me, I would start my day at 6am (which I try to do). ‘Then Iam done by 2 pm and have the whole day to do what I want to whether it's going for a swim or meeting friends,” she says.  On the day we meet her, she is looking radiant in a red one-shoulder top teamed with a white pencil skirt and it's difficult to believe she has been up since 4am. “Yeah, people were like, ‘you started your day at 4? But it’s not even a discussion for me, you know,” she states.  Pari, who was touted to be the ‘next big thing’ when she started her career with movies like Ladies vs Ricky Bahl (2011) and Ishaqzaade (2012), went through a low phase with Daawat-e-Ishg (2014) and Kill Dil (2014) flopping back to back. After abrief hiatus, she came back all guns blazing with a svelte bod and an item number in Dishoom (2016). Golmaal Again (2017), one of        the highest-grossing movies of all times, put her back in the major league. Now, with Kesari, which is based on the 1897 Battle of Saragarhi, and a few more movies lined up, the 10-film-old actress tells us about her learnings on the way.  @ You have said in earlier interviews that you were happy to be a small part of Kesari. ts it a redundant question then to ask if the length of the role matters anymore? Ithink with this par- ticular film, that discus- sion doesn’t hold for me. I just wanted to be a ‘part’ of this movie, pun intended (smiles). I didn’t ask Karan Johar (who is the producer) to tell me how long my screen time is. I just heard the story and said yes in- wanted to do it, so that 50 years from now, Ican proudly say that I was a part of Kesari. It’s one of those bucket-list films. I wish Thad some action sequences,           Ijust heard  the story and said yes instantly, I wanted to do it, so that 50 years from now, I can proudly say that I was a part of Kesari  A BUCKET-LIST ILM FOR WE’  Parineeti Chopra on playing Akshay Kumar's love interest in their movie based_on me i Battle of Saragarhi  ansgrou  but it was ae to bea part of the love story of this plot,  @ The trailer has received a tremendous response...  It isan incredible tale! It set over just two days and the most amazing part is that it’s a true story. These people actually existed. When I was reading it, I key exclaiming, ‘Are you serious? Did this really happen?’ Of course, it’s bee dramatised and told in an incredible cinematic, entertaining way. More thar anything, Kesari is about patriotism and the strength of these men. There is a scene in the film where somebody suggests that thi is a bad time and we should run away from the fort. You know what their response is? The men start laughing! Running away is the most bizarre thing for them. ‘That's the strength of this movie.         Apart from bonding with Akshay over starting the day early, how was the experienc of working with the superstar  Ithink he doesn’t realise how biga star he is, and I have been telling him from day one. I keep telling him i Punjabi, ‘Twanu maloom hi nahi hai tussi kaun ho’. He’ so real, so unfiltered that it shows the purity of his heart. He is not here to play games.  Contd on P

"Impressive doesn't begin to describe the job Tony has done with our baseball program these past two seasons,” Fulmer said. "I believe we have in Coach Vitello one of the nation's brightest young head coaches. From managing the game, to player development, to recruiting and relating to today's student-athletes—Tony has a firm grasp on all aspect of leading a major program. He's surrounded himself with an outstanding staff, and we are going to support them as Tennessee baseball continues to climb."

RCCG FASTING (WORLDWIDE)  SATURDAY, 16th Feb. 2019  DAY 37: PRAYER FOR SAFETY ON OUR ROADS  Travelling is becoming a burden these days rather than a pleasure, because of so many dreadful occurrences on our highways. Forces of darkness have invaded our roads, waterways and airways in perpetuating their evil agenda.  1. Praise and worship  2. Thank God for a new day and for the salvation of your soul.  3. Father In the name of Jesus, we come against every form of accident in Nigeria and abroad be it in the air, road or rail etc.  4, Father in Your mercy, safeguard Your children from ritualists and kidnappers on our highways in the name of Jesus (Psa. 91:1-2).  5. Father in Your mercy, safeguard Your children from accidents on our highways in the name of Jesus (Ps 91:1-2).  6. Father, let every blood sucking demon on our highways be put to shame this year in the name of Jesus.  7. Father, please be a wall of fire round about us, against every blood sucking demon on our way in the name of Jesus (Zec. 2:5).  8. Lord, we decree and declare that in 2019, every journey embarked upon by Your children be safe in the name of Jesus! (Isa3:10)  9. Father, let your angels go with us wherever we go this year in the name of Jesus. Psa. 121 10, Father, move our government to repair and construct roads conducive for travelling  this year so that the land will be safe for every journey in the name of Jesus.

Cen RCCG FASTING (WORLDWIDE)  SATURDAY, 26th Jan. 2019  DAY 16: POWER TO SEE THE GLORY  “and when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace!  But now they are hid from thine eyes”. Luke 19:41-42  Understanding Is a product of knowledge founded on deep revelation. Many people are living their lives anyhow because they cannot see the glory ahead. Jesus knowing the danger of spiritual blindness, lamented in sorrow In the above passage over Jerusalem.

“I love the people of Baltimore. It’s been 11 years. You come in, you feel one way, and you don’t know what to expect. The people warm up to you. You warm up to the people. To be honest with you, I can’t imagine a better 11 years. This place becoming my home and my children’s home. Just how many different life changes I went through and how much we won here. I’m not from too far up the road. People from here are a lot like the people I grew up with. Definitely a group of fans and a community that I loved to be around for 11 years.”

Fraternity, Inc. 4/15/2019  In light of recent events, we, Omega Delta Phi Fratemity, Inc., released a statement acknowledging allegations brought forward by survivors of sexual assault and their advocates. We recognize that words without action mean nothing, and we are prepared to make good on our word. We hope the actions outlined below serve as a catalyst for a greater push for accountability  ‘We have put together the following action items to not only hold those members accountable but also make sure we do our best to prevent any future incidents:  1) We have placed an immediate moratorium on all activities in our North Texas region as we investigate recent reports and allegations. This includes brotherhood & philanthropic events, new member showcases, and social mixers. Chapter business meetings, community service projects and other limited activities must be coordinated and approved with Student Affairs  2) We will be conducting an entity by entity audit, with university and regional support, to make sure that each entity's risk management reporting and investigations are following protocol.  3) We have opened and will be opening a number of investigations nationwide into ALL recent reports and allegations. Those under investigation will be under indefinite suspension in order to promote safety and due process.  4) We are working internally to provide better training and controls into our organization. Some ‘examples that we are currently working on immediately implementing are:  «Requiring background checks in the new member process.  ‘+ Attending mandatory educational programming on sexual harassment and sexual assault between the chapter and its prospective members.  ‘+ Requiring training/workshop at our national conference covering respect, consent, social media, sexual harassment, and sexual assault including a victim panel.  * Developing an online reporting platform for safe and secure incident and risk management reporting along with expanding our compliance and code of conduct training,     As we previously stated, words are words, but actions are what count and we are taking these first steps today to bring forth a culture of change in our organization that we can be proud of and promote our sacraments through our actions.  Today, we begin our joumey to prove our dedication to be a safer, more educated, and respectful organization  Thank you Sincerely  The National Executive Council Omega Delta Phi Fratemity, Inc.

#AUTOSPORT Ds  "Dr Marko said that he is a 'racing purist’. For me it is an argument [that is] a bit false, because it depends a lot from what this means for people," di Grassi continued.  "What exactly is this thought? [Does he] defend races with horses instead of cars?  "If he is a real racing purist, he should defend horse races. Or races with just combustion engines, without hybrid systems as F1 is nowadays.  "Or cars with full manual gearboxes, without paddleshift, [which is] how it is nowadays in F1 - it is an open argument.  "This is more his personal opinion of saying: ‘look, | don't want to compete in Formula E, I'm too old for this and want to do combustion races in F1'.  "Fis still the most important category of the world of motorsport, nobody can deny this. But the future of the manufacturers is electric."

Last weekend, President Trump sent a tweet that reminded us once again just how dangerously out of touch he is on climate change.  @ mame ED.  Be careful and try staying in your house. Large pars ofthe Country aie sufering from     Make no mistake: Leading scientists are sounding the alarm that our planet is headed toward climate catastrophe if urgent action isn't taken, and taken fast. Our own president's willful ignorance shows that he still doesn't understand that weather is not the same as climate change.

What is Martin Luther King, Jr. Day?  Today is Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. It is a special day when we celebrate the life of a man named Martin Luther King. He taught us that all people should be treated the same, no matter their skin color or how much money they have.  Martin Luther King was born in Georgia in 1929. We call him “Doctor King” because he learned a lot and could teach us many things. Dr. King was also a pastor.  At that time, black children could not go to the same schools as white children. People with brown skin had to use different drinking fountains, restrooms, swimming pools, hotels, busses, and restaurants. They were not treated kindly or respectfully. Sometimes they could not even sit next to white people at church, even though they all called themselves Christians. This was called “segregation.”     Many people thought this was okay. Dr. King did not. He knew that the Bible teaches that we are all made by God, so we are all important. God loves black people. No matter what we look like on the outside, we are all little mirrors reflecting God’s beauty. Dr. King also knew that Jesus taught us to love people even when they hurt us.  Dr. King led peaceful protests to change unfair laws. Protest means telling people, “This is wrong! This must stop!” Peaceful means when people hurt Dr. King he didn’t hurt them back. He wanted people with darker skin to be treated the same as people with lighter skin. He wanted poor people to be treated with respect. Many black people and some white people worked to change our country. It was a struggle. Not everybody liked what Dr. King did. They wanted to keep things the same. Dr. King was attacked many times. Sometimes they put him in jail.  Many things changed because of Martin Luther King. Many Americans learned that it was wrong to treat black people differently. Many laws were changed. But even today, sometimes we forget the things Dr. King taught us. Sometimes we are unkind and selfish. Some laws still treat people unfairly. Sometimes we treat people who look different from us like they’re not important. Dear God, please keep changing us!  Dr. King died when he was only 39 years old. He was hurt by somebody who hated him. It was a very sad day.  The third Monday of January is a holiday when we celebrate Martin Luther King’s life. He made mistakes like all of us, but God used him powerfully to make our country a better place. We can keep making it better by remembering the things Dr. King taught us,  © 2018 Duke Kwon

In response to an AFP raid on 5 June of the ABC Ultimo office in Sydney, ABC Managing Director David Anderson said  “it is highly unusual for the national broadcaster to be raided in this way. This is a serious development and raises legitimate concerns over freedom of the press and proper public scrutiny of national security and defence matters.  “The ABC stands by its journalists, will protect its sources and continue to report without fear or favour on national security and intelligence issues when there is a clear public interest.”

x Peg  MEDIA INFORMATION  PETCO PARK, 100 PARK BOULEVARD, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101 619.795.5265 / FAX: 619.795.5266  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, February 21, 2019  PADRES SIGN INFIELDER MANNY MACHADO TO 10-YEAR CONTRACT  SAN DIEGO ~The San Diego Padres have signed infielder Manny Machado to a 10-year, $300 million contract through the 2028 season, Executive Vice President/General Manager A.J. Preller announced today. The agreement, which is the largest for a free agent in Major League history, includes an opt-out clause after the 2023 season. To make room for Machado on the 40-man roster, the Padres transferred right-hander Dinelson Lamet to the 60-day Injured List.  In 162 games between the Baltimore Orioles and Los Angeles Dodgers last season, Machado batted .297 (188-for-632) with a 6.2 WAR (FanGraphs) .367 OBP, .538 SLG, .905 OPS, 35 doubles, three triples, 37 home runs, 107 RBI (career high), 70 walks, 14 stolen bases and 84 runs scored. The 26-year- Old tied for the most games played in MLB and finished T-3" in hits, 4 in total bases (340), T-6% in multi- hit games (54), T-7" in game-winning RBI (14), T-8 in RBI, 9" in WAR, T-9" in HR, and 11" in SLG and OPS. His splits between right and left-handed pitchers were nearly identical, as he posted a .298/.358/.539  slash line against righties and a .297/.386/.535 line versus southpaws. During the 2018 postseason, Machado homered in three of his firs five games and reached base safely in 13 of 16 games overall.  “Manny Machado is a generational talent, and we're ecstatic that he's chosen to spend his prime years in a San Diego Padres uniform,” Padres Executive Chairman Ron Fowler and General Partner Peter Seidler said in a joint statement today. “This momentous agreement speaks volumes to the direction of our organization, as well as our commitment to bringing a World Series Championship to the Friar Faithful and the City of San Diego.”  “Manny is one of the truly elite players in baseball and impacts the game on both sides of the ball,” said Preller. “The resume that Manny has built at such a young age puts him in an exclusive club of big- league talent, and we feel fortunate to have the support of Ron, Peter and the entire ownership group to make this deal possible. We've spent the last several years building a foundation of talent throughout our  : eons @ @PadresPR-11m —  The Padres have signed infielder VEIN Machado to a 10-year, $300 action contract through the PAOyas: Season, Executive Vice President/G.     19) wr fa  Tweet your reply

CGRP an edited [ies iKel tt) ay ier Wa LATER...

THERE’S NOTHING SUPER ABOUT ALP’S TAX PLANS  JOSH FRYDENBERG  The opposition says it will introduce four new taxes on retirement savings if it wins office  The tax concessions that support Australia’s $27 trillion superan- nuation system are designed to encourage people to save for their retirement. They should not be sacrificed to fill Labor's black hole and pay foritsreckless spending. In yet another desperate cash grab, Labor has announced it will introduce four new taxes on superannuation, raising $19 bil- lion. These taxes will hitaboutone million workers, including mums and dads taking parental leave, those taking time to look after a sick relative, tradies wanting to start their own business and indi- viduals wanting to make volun- tary contributions to. self-fund their retirement. acs super taxes will not only discourage people to save but they also will punish those who do, and they ultimately represent another attack on aspiration and  hardworking Australians. Labor has promised to remove the right, already legislated by the Coali- tion, of superannuants to make catch-up contributions when their super balance is less than $500,000. The unused conces- sional contributions can now be carried forward five years.  Labor's policy will hurt about 250,000 people who, for a variety of reasons, have interrupted their work patterns and have been unable tomake afull contribution to their super in any particular year. This could bea teacher or a nurse who takes a year off to raise a child or look after a relative On return towork, they wantto make a catch-up contributions and still receive thetax concession.  Under Labor's policy a 30- year-old iff the workforce today who takes four years off to raise their family could be more than $300,000 worse off in retirement.  With women retiring with just more than half the super balances of men, Labor's policy to abolish catch-up contributions will make it even harder to close the savings gap. This is despite opposition Treasury spokesman Chris. Bowen saying, when he was min- ister for financial services, super- annuation and corporate law, that “the government recognises that many workers want to make larg- er catch-up superannuation con- tributions as they approach retirement”, then going on to say that allowing these “catch-up” contributions would “particularly benefit people who have had peri- ods outside the workforce, thema- jority of whom are women’.  Second, deductions for per- sonal superannuation contribu tions already legislated will be reversed “About 800,000 workers are estimated to benefit from the concession that allows them to work part time, taking a salary while establishing their business. This concession specifi- cally encourages the dual objec- tive of entrepreneurship and savings for retirement, and helps strengthen the small-business sector — the backbone of the economy.  Labor willallow these budding stnall-business people to get a de- duction for their super contribu tions only when more than 90 per cent of their income is coming from their business. This could deter workers from contributing to their super and see a 20-year- old worker today nearly $500,000 worseoffinretirement.  What Labor doesn't under- stand is that emerging businesses  taketime toget off the groundand often require their owners to earn asalary at another job to provide the cashflow needed to make the business grow. These small-busi- ness owners deserve the same incentives to save as other work- ing Australians,        Labor claims its “measures will make the system fairer”. How is it fair to punish the shop owner, the plumber and the software engin- eer for wanting to start their own business and save for their own retirement?  ‘Third, Labor is promising to reduce thénon-Cconcessional con- tribution cap from $100,000 to $75,000, which will hit about 20,000 taxpayers.  The issue is not whether the contribution should be taxed at the individual's marginal rate, as that is not in dispute, but whether individuals should be given the choice and flexibility to contribute more in any particular year in the event that their capacity to do so increases. It’s about striking the rightbalance.  ‘The sale of a family property or a deceased relative leaving an inheritance may enable a person to put more money into their super in that particular year. That is not something to be discour- aged. For example, under Labor, a 45-year-old would not Be able to put $300,000 into their super fol- lowing the sale of their home and as a result would be $160,000 worse off in retirement.  Fourth, concessional contribu- tions taxed at 15 per cent on the way in are now available to those on incomes of $250,000 or less.  Labor is proposing to reduce thé Threshold to $200,000, doub- ling the tax for 130,000 people who ear between $200,000 and $250,000. year to 30 per cent.  Again, Labor gets the balance wrong, focusing on revenue rai ing to chase spending. For some- body aged 47 with 20 more years until retirement, Labor's policy will reduce their savings at retire- ment bymorethan $100,000.  As part of its $200bn tax grab,     Labor's plan for $19bn of new  Superannuation taxes —_goes against everything it has said in the past.  In his book Hearts and Minds,  Bowen launched an enthusiastic defence of super tax concessions, saying: “Theyarejustifiedbecause they avoid future payments of the age pension and they help boost ‘our pool of savings, with all the     benefits for the economy that this brings.” He went onto say that re- ducing these concessions “creates uncertainty for and concern by people who are making volunta contributions to superannuation’  ‘There was also a time when his leader, Bill Shorten, shared this view. Talking about the import- ance of superannuation “tax con- cessionality”, Shorten said as minister for financial services and superannuation that “Labor  otaher ever, never, never, never gives up on superannuation”. Surprise,sur- prise, one “never” for every new Laborsupertax.  ‘Labor's track record on taxing superannuation is clear. Despite Kevin Rudd promising, on theeve of the 2007 election, that Labor wouldn't change superannuation “one jot, one tittle”, Labor when last in government irfiposed $9bn_ in new super taxes. This included an increase, announced by Bowen 48 hours after he proclaimed in a memorable press release an immediate “five-year freeze on superannuation change:  If given the chance in govern- ment, Australians should not be under any illusions about Labor's, approach to superannuation its plan for $19bn of higher, mis- guided taxes and the further tar- geting of aspirational Australians.               Josh Frydenberg is the federal Treasurer.  Labor's policy to ‘abolish catch-up contributions will make it even harder for women to close the savings gap

COMMENT MARCH 16 2019, 12:01AM, THE TIMES  New Zealand shootings:  Muslims are fearful and  hurting but we must not give in to hate  MAAJID NAWAZ  Gq;  esterday’s attack announces the  lowest point for Muslim  communities in the West since the Bosnia genocide. This is now the single biggest terror attack in Australasia, equal in number of victims to the Orlando nightclub shooting in 2016. It will change for ever how we view the new and emerging category of white supremacist and anti- Muslim terrorism.

LIB renee  Hey so, French person here. And also an ex History student. 'm here to say: Please listen to 0.p. above.  Obviously everyone is shocked but here's a few important key facts:  ‘+The roofs completely gone. Part of it dated back from the 13th century but the rest was from the 19th. The stone arch roof under the top roof is fine,  ‘One of the three main stained glass rose windows has fallen out. Most of the other stained glass windows are okay.  + The spire has fallen down and that's the saddest part. BUT! It was in the process of being restored and the 16 statues that were there were removed just four days agol So they're fine.  ‘The main structure is stil here and nothing has “burned down’ unlike what some people have been saying.  + The “treasure’ (sacred objects) is safe  Notre Dame is still there. I's just damaged. Almost nothing was lost today, and nobody was wounded either. it's scary, but i's gonna be okay.

To compile this data, geographers at University College London used phone directories to find the predominant surnames in each state, Software then identified the probable provenances of the 181 names that emerged.  Many of these names came from Great Britain, reflecting the long head start the British had over many other setters. The low diversity  cof names in parts of the British Isles also had an impact. Willams, for example, was a common name among Welsh immigrants~and is stil among the top names in many American states,  But that’s not the only factor. Slaves often took their owners  names, so about one in five Americans now named Smith are African  American in addition, many newcomers’ names were anglicizea to.ease assimilation. The map's scale matters too. “If we did a map of New York like this” says project member James Cheshire, “the diversity would be phenomenal’—a testament to that citys role as ‘a once-and:present gateway to America. ~A.

Polk County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Brian Bruchey explained that there is no automatic enforcement mechanism to take guns away from people who have been ordered to hand  them over as part of a pre-trial release.  “We really don’t have authority to take firearms from people unless they are surrendered or there is a court order,” Bruchey said. “We can’t do anything, unless they  willfully do it — release them to us.”  “Technically if the person does have firearms they are in violation of the injunction or pre- trial release but it’s one of those things — it’s kind of hard to enforce, really. You’d have to have somebody to say ‘I know exactly where they are’ ... and you’d have to get a search warrant for it. It’s one of those things you hope people do the right thing and surrender  their guns,” Bruchey explained. wi

This is blatant political censorship. The list of political speech harassment by these huge left-leaning platforms (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube) should be deemed illegal. There is no similar list of silencing political views on the left, and publishers of Antisemitic and Anti-lsrael and Jihadi Pro-Istalmist sites spewing Jew-hatred continue to proliferate and flourish.

\\ THE BOSTON / \ MARATHON (|
Death of Bob Hawke  With Bob Hawke’s passing today, the great partnership I enjoyed with him passes too. A partnership we forged with the Australian people.  But what remains and what will endure from that partnership are the monumental foundations of modern Australia.  In what was our last collaboration, Bob and I were delighted to support Bill Shorten last week in recounting the rationale we employed in opening Australia  to the world.  Bob, of course, was hoping for a Labor victory this weekend. His friends too, were hoping he would see this.  Bob possessed a moral framework for his important public life, both representing the workers of Australia and more broadly, the country at large.  He understood that imagination was central to policy-making and never lacked the courage to do what had to be done to turn that imagination into reality.  And that reality was the reformation of Australia’s economy and society and its place in the world.  No one will miss Bob more than his wife, Blanche, who very sweetly, attended his every need, particularly in these later years.  His children, Susan, Stephen and Rosslyn loved their father and were deeply committed to the precepts of his public life.  Bob’s death will be an enormous loss to them and their children, of whom, he was eternally proud.  The country is much the poorer for Bob Hawke’s passing.  Sydney 16 May 2019

GORDON  25 MOORE 8 LEAKE  SEATTLE MARINERS vs. MINNESOTA TWINS TUESDAY - 5:10 P.M.  Pa  AS WCU RAS SUL a

Over the last several days, a number of news organizations have reported on selectively leaked information about internal Trump campaign polling, particularly related to Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The truth is, the picture being painted is intentionally false, because the information only pertains to a subset of questions asked. Naturally, the fake news media has reported it breathlessly because it fits their preferred narrative about President Trump. The media’s general fixation on reporting head-to-head matchups polled 18 months before an election is pointless, because the results are so speculative as to be almost meaningless. Not one of the Democrats in the field has been through what will be a brutal primary, and they have not yet engaged in a general election with President Trump. Rest assured, when both of those things happen, the numbers will tell a different story.  The fact is that President Trump has experienced his greatest climb in approval, to its highest point since he took|office and it continues to grow. In our data, the President is in a better position today than he was in 2016, when tested against any defined opponent. We will win these states again in 2020, and in fact, expand the map to include new states where the President was competitive in 2016. This is also supported by public polling, which has shown the President’s job approval rising, as more and more voters are feeling the positive impact of the continually improving Trump economy.  As voters are educated about the socialist policies of the 2020 Democrats, the President’s numbers will only get stronger. After reviewing polling data from President Obama’s re-election, we can say unequivocally that President Trump is in a significantly better position now than Obama was at the same point in his presidency. If the current projected direction continues, President Trump will win Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin as part of an electoral landslide.

i think daenerys is the embodiment of the tragedy of game of thrones. they gave us this character who was abused and started with nothing. she built herself up, and yes, she did have many moments where we were worried for her state of mind, but for the most part we were shown a girl who was trying to be better and protect the lives of innocents. then, for us to have the rug ripped out from under our feet, and to show us that she’s become exactly what she fought so hard not to be is tragic, but it is fitting for a show that wasn’t supposed to have a happy ending in the first place, and for a show that planned on this character going mad from the beginning.
