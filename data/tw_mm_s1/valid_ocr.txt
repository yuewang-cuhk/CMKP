PARLIAMENT OF AUSTRALIA     Prime Minister H.E. General Prayut Chan- Office of the Prime Minister  Government House  Phitsanulok Road  Dusit, Bangkok 10300, Thailand  Dear Prime Minister Prayut Chan-Ocha,  ‘We write in our capacity as Co-Chairs of the Australian Parliament's Parliamentary Friends of Football, in support of calls for Mr Hakeem Ali Alaraibi to be released from detention in Thailand, and immediately returned to Australia,  The footballing community in Australia holds Mr Alaraibi in high regard and has been raising concerns for him as a valuable member of their footballing community.  Mr Alaraibi was granted permanent residency by the Australian Government in 2017 in recognition of his status as a refugee. Returning Mr Alaraibi to Bahrain, from where he fled, would contravene his rights under international human rights law.  Itis our understanding that the Interpol Red Notice that Mr Alariabi was detained under was incorrectly issued in contravention of Interpol's own regulations to not subject refugees to Red Notices issued by the country from which they flee, and has since been withdrawn.  We are particularly concerned by reports that Mr Alaraibi may be subject to torture if he is returned to Bahrain, the sort of treatment that led to his granting of refugee status in the first instance.  We respectfully request that Mr Alaraibi be allowed to return to Australia as soon as possible, and are deeply grateful for your consideration.  Yours sincerely,  Miptsd  Senator Murray Watt Bert van Manen MP Co-Chair, Parliamentary Friends of Football Co-Chair, Parliamentary Friends of Football     Padiamentary Friends of Football Parliament House, Canberra ACT 2600, Australia

Frederick VeSoue       In honor of Black History month, i wanna introduce you to a person, who has been an inspiration to many people, people that thought they could never get into shape, because they lacked influence, or not motitvated, or just think that what they do won't pay off, most of the people are like you and me, they like anime and manga, and so want to be like their favorite characters. but never think they could be like them because characters like Goku, Vegeta, Natsu Dragneel, Gray Fullbuster are really buffed and jacked up, but this one person can prove that with inspriation and setting goals, you CAN be like your favorite characters, this person is named Jordan "JaxBlade" Downs  Downs, (bom Dec. 31 1990) was a kid that loved cartoons and everything about them, His all time Favorite anime growing up was Dragon Ball Z, and he loved everything about the show, but as a kid he was kinda tubby and fat and would always get bullied and picked on in school because he liked DBZ 0 much and the kids would tease him and say "you'll never be like the characters from that show" and they would slap him around, and punch him and say "what you gonna do huh? so he would return home feel down and depressed and would ease his pain eating snacks and playing his Dragon Ball video games. Until one day he decided, "hmmm what would my favorite characters do in a situation like 'm in?" and he remember Goku, that ever though he was really strong, he was really kind to people and treated them like equals, so he decided to get himself into shape, with the help with some trainers and his motivation to be like his favorite characters  He's done various workouts to help him achieve the body he always wanted and has done clean eating and imminent fasting to help him shed fat and build muscle. A lot of people hear his story and have been inspired by him. you can be an Anime nerd and stil be in the best shape of your lifel! this guy is an inspiration to us all

OSTALAECO  Ontario Student l'Association des éléves conseillers Trustees’ Association et conseilléres de l'Ontario  Cellphones are a vital learning tool in 21% century classrooms. It is more effective for a student to learn how to manage something than to have it be taken away completely. Educators should see cell phones as a tool to enhance education and teach students when to effectively use them. As this technology becomes more of an inevitable part of our society, it is crucial for students to learn how to prioritize when to use it, and decide which functions are productive in a formal setting. For many schools, cell phones are important tools for accessing online resources due to lack of funding or availability of technology and should not be completely banned. Managing their use is important, but should be left to the discretion of teachers out of respect for school board and classroom autonomy, as individual classroom needs are best understood by teachers and school boards. OSTA-AECO looks forward to reviewing the results of the 2018 education consultations and viewing the breakdown of student input into these decisions.  Amal Qayum, OSTA-AECO President

Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain are moving across the landscapes, over the prairies and the deep trees, the mountains and the rivers. ‘Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air, _ are heading home again.  er you are, no matter how lonely, world offers itself to your imagination, you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting— er announcing your place of things.

Anti-ship missiles fired from a naval asset were probably used in the attacks, it said.  The attacks on two tankers on Thursday have stoked regional tensions, with oil tanker owners reluctant to send vessels to the region. The U.S. has said it will consider providing naval escorts for commercial ships travelling through the Strait of Hormuz, the chokepoint at the southern end of the Persian Gulf. The U.S. has blamed Iran for the attacks on both vessels, while Tehran denies the accusations.

While I was coaching the under-16s a couple of boys really caught my eye. Trent Arnold has a terrific chance of making it as a top professional. He’s quite leggy but he’s got a lovely frame and seems to have all the attributes you need. Having just turned sixteen, he’s still not strong enough at the moment, but that will come. He has the right attitude and comes from West Derby, home to Melwood. So Trent is another Scouser and apparently, just as I tried to be John Barnes and Steve Mc- Mahon, he grew up pretending to be me while playing in the Merseyside parks. He can play as a number 6, a holding mid- fielder, but he’s versatile and I’ve seen him fill various positions.  I know England are all over him.

“Kenney  BAU: policy could pa Blt ay Seite built.” at risk.”  - Don Braid, Calgary Herald     Authorized by Alberta’s NDP yr  - rachelnotley.ca

| have written to the Prime Minister laying out Labour's alternative plan so we can move beyond the mess the Tories have made of Brexit.  ‘The Tory failure has left the country deeply divided and facing the threat of a disastrous No Deal outcome. Labour can and must take a lead in bringing our country together.  ‘We are convinced that our sensible altemative, set out in the five demands in my letter, could both win the support of parliament and bring together those who voted Leave and Remain.     More than any other party, Labour represents the hopes and ambitions of millions, of people across all parts of our country.  ‘Whether people live in Tottenham or Mansfield, they face the same problems of austerity, the injustice of Universal Credit and insecure work. The real divide in our country is not between Leave and Remain, but between the many and the few.     | believe our alternative plan - which includes a permanent customs union, staying close to the single market, and full guarantees on workers’ rights, consumer standards and environmental protections ~ can help move us beyond divisions over Brexit and lay the {ground for the transformation of our country that only a Labour government can deliver.  Theresa May is unable to reach a sensible deal because it would split the Tories ~ and we will never vote for a bad Tory deal.  If Partiament is deadlocked, then the best outcome would be a general election. Without it we will keep all options on the table, as agreed in our party conference motion, including the option of a public vote.  Thank you,  Jeremy Corbyn Leader of the Labour Party
The government has one intention - which is to try to string out and create a crisis aT aaaTINK lal SI Og now and then on this issue to try to stoke a bit of fear.”  — Tony Burke, Manager of  Opposition Business in the Ls [o]U sty

The 2013 election's new entrant, the Palmer United Party (PUP), displayed weaker flows of preferences. Despite its how-to-vote material recommending preferences to the Coalition in every electorate, only 53.7 percent of PUP voters followed the recommendation. Preferences favoured Labor in 43 electorates and the Coalition 96. Preferences flows to the Coalition ranged from 39.3 percent in Labor-held Calwell, to 64.7 percent in National-held Gippsland. There was only a weak relationship between the flow of preferences to the Coalition and the PUP first preference vote share.

WESTMOORE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT-ATHLETE NAMED GATORADE OKLAHOMA BASEBALL PLAYER OF THE YEAR  CHICAGO (May 23, 2019) — In its 34!" year of honoring the nation’s best high school athletes, The Gatorade Company, today announced Kale Davis of Westmoore High School as its 2018-19 Gatorade Oklahoma Baseball Player of the Year. Davis is the third Gatorade Oklahoma Baseball Player of the Year to be chosen from Westmoore High School.  The award, which recognizes not only outstanding athletic excellence, but also high standards of academic achievement and exemplary character demonstrated on and off the field, distinguishes Davis as Oklahoma’s best high school baseball player. Now a finalist for the prestigious Gatorade National Baseball Player of the Year award to be announced in May, Davis joins an elite alumni association of state award-winners in 12 sports, including Derek Jeter (1991-92, Kalamazoo High School, Mich.), Jon Lester (2001-02, Bellarmine Preparatory School, Wash.), David Price (2003-04, Blackman High School, Tenn.), Clayton Kershaw (2005-06, Highland Park High School, Texas), Rick Porcello (2006-2007, Seaton Hall Preparatory School, N.J.) and Kris Bryant (2009-10, Bonanza High School, Nev.).  The 6-foot-4, 220-pound senior right-handed pitcher and infielder compiled a 9-1 record with a 0.36 ERA to go with 94 strikeouts and 17 walks in 58 innings, leading the Jaguars to the Class 6A quarterfinals this past season. The 2019 Central Oklahoma Athletic Conference Pitcher of the Year and the No. 2-ranked prep prospect in the state by Perfect Game, Davis also batted .329 with 17 RBI and an on-base percentage of .508.

Acti Jlude foreign and US domestic signals collection, in regards to communications with Russian hostite actors.       2. 10CCO approved FULSOME on 15 September 2016, allowing 90 days of initial SIGINT gathering, with the potential for renewal, should the situation allow. This memo’s purpose is to request a 90 day renewal of FULSOME's original charter, with  further potential for renewal, thereafter.  3. Since FULSOME’s start, a clear patter of actionable leads have accrued, both from the Trump campaign itself, from former MIS agent Michael Steele, and from others (see fig, 1-7 in attachment).  4. US National Security Advisor Rice has requested that we continue our surveillance, during the transition period, as internal US intelligence is potentially compromised.  by the incoming Trump administration,     5. For these reasons, we are requesting that FULSOME’s charter be renewed for another 90 days.

In this world of fame and wanting to build an empire you've always got my back just like I've got yours. You're the definition of beauty, substance, class, subtlety, eloquence, intelligence, intellect and maturity. You saw right through me when no one else did and till this day you still do. No matter how tough i act you always have my mumu button lol. You were termed "fake" and i remember telling you the world would eventually adjust, they would realise you were raised differently. | could go on and on but i'ma whisper the rest in your cute lil ears! @  Today you turn 30, a significant number.

Anew Mike Leach story from Lincoln Riley...  The top 10 | can't tell you. He's just, he’s a beauty. | know | told the one before of my first position meeting there. I'm from Muleshoe, Texas. I've seen guys put in big dips before. But he he put in the biggest dip any human being has ever put in. Ever. | mean | was just blown away. He had so much he had it all over his face number one . He had so much in his mouth he couldn't like really talk. Like he couldn't get the words out. So I'm sitting there thinking, and it's day one and | just walked on and have to learn this offense that's revolutionizing football and. He starts to almost were dip’s made and. how they cut it and the different types of tobacco and how you pack the can and if you drink lemon juice or lime juice after it'll help bring your lip back so that you can keep putting it in. It's an hour and a half meeting and all he talks about is dip. Then he's like, all right, it's time to go to practice. Not one word not. Not one word - you think I'm kidding. Not one word in 90 minutes about football. Not one word. We go out there to practice and | had to go out there and ask B.J. (Symons) and those guys, ‘what the hell are we doing. so yeah, that was just just another normal day with Mike.

The issue is why you want to see it so bad.  You need something to validate your irrational rage. You WANTED the President to be a Russian Asset. You HOPED that Democracy failed. You're still hoping. Because you're bitter that you lost.  You should evaluate your reasoning. Have you ever demanded to see a government document before?  Did you demand the findings in Benghazi? Did you demand to see Hillary's E-Mail investigation findings? What about UraniumOne? What about the investigation that found Obama's admin was giving unaccompanied minors to traffickers?  Did you demand the release of the full report on any of that? No?  So why do you think that is your argument now?  Are you demanding Jussie Smollets case be turned public?  No. You've been fed a media narrative.  "If you don't have drugs in your house then why can't | come in?"  It's the same logical fallacy that cops use to manipulate you into surrendering your rights.

South Australia’s Murray Darling Basin royal commission was marred by a lack of cooperation between the federal and state government, with the commonwealth even prepared to litigate in the high court to prevent its public servants being called.  In his final report royal commissioner Bret Walker said he did not fight the case because he was not granted an extension of time, but said there was “no doubt that compulsory processes of this royal commission could be enforced in other states and territories of the commonwealth”.  “This is no more remarkable than the effective service of court process, such as a subpoena, requiring a resident of Wodonga to attend court in Albury. Extra-territoriality was never an issue.”

His eyes aren't as good as they used to be, so we weren't exactly letting it fly.  It's one of those experiences that you kind of took for granted when you were young when you're like, “Man, | might not be able to do that again.’ But the stars aligned.

Q: What does innovative mean to you? Matt LaFleur: | just think it's a constant pursuit to try to stay one step ahead of the game. Because if you stay stagnant and you don't evolve, | think people catch up to you. You're constantly studying not only your tape, but around the league, there's a lot of good ideas out there. You look at Kansas City and what Andy Reid is able to do, and Matt Nagy and some of these other guys that maybe aren't part of our system, if you will. At the same time, you don't want to be a grab bag of just taking it, trying to steal everybody's stuff. It's whether or not it fits within the framework of your offense. | think it comes down to, | love watching football, whether it's our team or somebody else. I'm always going to try to see if we can implement something else that maybe a defense hasn't seen from us.

1)  2)  3)  4) 5)  6) 7)  8) 9)  Early 2018: Trump’s lawyers reach an impasse with Mueller/Weissmann over obstruction — and in particular over the proper interpretation of 18 USC § 1512(c)(2). Trump’s lawyers realize that Mueller/Weissmann’s expansive interpretation of 1512(c)(2) will allow the investigation to continue on indefinitely — every time Trump comments against the investigation, that’s another potential instance of obstruction to investigate.  Trump’s lawyers look for a workaround — convincing Rosenstein that Weissmann’s theory is fatally flawed to get Rosenstein to rein them in.  They think about who Rosenstein will find credible and go with Bill Barr, former AG. Barr was AG when Rosenstein was just starting out at DOJ as a trial attorney — they figure Rosenstein will respect Barr.  Trump’s lawyers meet with Barr (then in private practice at Kirkland & Ellis), explain the Mueller/Weissmann interpretation of 1512(c)(2), and convince Barr to help  Barr writes a fantastic memo to Rosenstein/Engel explaining every problem with Mueller/Weissmann interpretation of 1512(c)(2).  Rosenstein ignores it  Trump’s lawyers realize that with Rosenstein/Mueller/Weissmann all in opposition to them on the 1512(c)(2) question, the only way to get the obstruction probe shut down is with a new, un-recused AG.  10) Given that midterms are a few months away, they decide to hold off on replacing  Sessions until the midterms, but start doing succession planning.  11) They think — why not Bill Barr as AG? He’s a former AG, clearly confirmable, who we  have literally just worked with and like, and we know agrees with our view of the law.  12) The day after the midterms AG Sessions is asked for his resignation. 13) Only name ever publicly floated is Bill Barr, seen as “consensus pick” that Trump has  “huge respect” for  14) In reality — it’s his lawyers who have huge respect for Barr — and know that his  confirmation will mean the end of the Mueller probe in short order.  15) Barr is confirmed and within six weeks the Mueller probe is over.

CAN’T SAY NO TO  ee A With Akshay revisiting Tip Tip Barsa Paani for Sooryavanshi, Venus —F  head honcho Ratan Jain reveals why he parted with Mohra song’s rights  UPALA KBR hitlist@mid-day.com  ALMOST 25 years after he gave Bolly- wood one of its most sizzling numbers Tip Tip Barsa Paani from Mohra (1994), Akshay Kumar is ready to revisit the song for Sooryavanshi. Matching him step for step in the romantic track will be co-star Katrina Kaif. Interestingly, Kumar played a significant role in en- suring that the '90s ditty found a place in the Rohit Shetty-directed actioner Turns out, Ratan Jain, the head honcho of Venus that owns the rights of the original number, parted with the song owing to his 30-year-long association with Kumar.  A trade source says, “Ratan Jain and Akshay go back a long way with the producer's Khiladi [1991] proving to be the latter's / breakthrough film. They / have delivered some of [ their biggest hits together, § a including Main Khiladi Tu \ Anari [1994], Garam Masa.                Akshay Kumar and Raveena Tandon in Tip Tip Barsa Paani  Speaking to mid-day, Jain says “\\. that he was glad to help his A\ favourite actor and frequent \ collaborator. “The primary  } reason I parted with the  } rights is because Akshay  is doing the song again. I  J, ave the highest regard for  os } \ & \  la [2005] and De Dana Dan Ngan /, him as an actor and a per-  2009]. When Rohit and Fa- “ rah [Khan, choreographer] were discussing possible chartbusters that could be reprised for Sooryavanshi, it was Akshay who suggested Tip Tip Barsa Paani. He then called up Ratan ji torequesthim for the rights. Rohitand Akshay were also toying with the idea of revisiting another song from the 90s — Bholi Bhali Ladki from Sabse Bada Khiladi [1995], but finally zeroed in on the Mohra track.”        son. I would not have given the song to any other producer Having said that, it's not a complete transfer of rights. I have parted with the song for a particular period, after which the rights will be reinstated with us” Quiz him if the makers will be able to do justice to a number that has gained a cult status in Bollywood over the decades, and he says, “It'sa big film, and they will definitely take care of the quality of the song”  oF               Ratan Jain

They spread lies and run with whatever they're told.  They almost ruined the lives of students who haven't even graduated high school yet. This is serious.

On Tarasenko and being one of those rare scorers who can score from anywhere on the ice; one element that stands out to you what makes him as effective as he is shooting it: He hides his stick, meaning that he keeps it. He's a lot like what Recchi was. He keeps it square, so you're not sure what side of the net it's going on. When you hold your stick blade that square, the goalie has to start guessing, and that's what he does. He makes the goalie guess. You're thinking it's going to go long side and it's going short side and it's because he hides it there. He doesn't telegraph which way it's going until the last possible minute. Those guys make you real nervous because it's not just that he can score from anywhere, he can score from any angle. He doesn't need the far side of the net from an angle. He can be on the short side because he makes you flinch, and he's good at that.

ME  DC CORRESPONDENT     Nw Superstar Salman  Khan always places a list of terms and conditions before doing a film. The actor who has always refused to kiss on screen has often made headlines for turning it down. The Dabangg actor has romanced a number of actresses on the silver screen but, Khan has never kissed his lead- ing lady in any of his films. The reason for the same was revealed recently by his brother Arbaaz Khan when the three Khan brothers           graced a talk show. In the recent romo. shared on their social media handle, Salman was asked about his aversion to kissing on- screen. But before        4 4 IF HE WOULD HAVE DONE THAT, THERE WOULDN'T BE A NEED FOR ONE OFF-SCREEN        Salman could give a suitable answer, Arbaaz spilled the beans and said, “If he would have done that, there wouldn’t be a need for one off-screen”  — ARBAAZ KHAN

ASYLUM SEEKER CHILDREN OFF NAURU  Every asylum seeker child has now been removed from Nauru or has had their claim processed and has a clear path off the island.  Our strong border protection policies mean we’ve been able to stop the boats and work through the backlog of cases Labor created when 50,000 people arrived on 800 boats on their watch.  There were 109 asylum seeker children on Nauru at the end of August 2018 at the time we took on our respective roles as Prime Minister and Minister for Immigration.  Since then, and as was made clear at the time, we have been working quietly and methodically through this process without compromising the integrity of Operation Sovereign Borders. There are now only four asylum seeker children on Nauru and they have all been approved for departure to the United States of America with their families.  We have got all the children Labor put in detention centres out, and we have shut down all the detention centres Labor opened, including on Christmas Island. Australia has one of the most generous humanitarian immigration programs in the world, but we can only do it by maintaining strong borders and insisting people come the right way.

STATEMENT FROM MAYOR EMANUEL, CTA PRESIDENT CARTER ON APPLE-CTA PARTNERSHIP Apple today announced that later this year, transit customers will be able to put a transit-only card into their iPhone. With this new feature, customers will be able to tap their phone to board a bus or enter CTA rail stations using a Ventra Card on their iPhone. Chicago will be one of the first transit agencies in the U.S. to debut this function.  Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) President Dorval Carter released the following statement. “Chicago is proud to work with Apple to elevate the experience of CTA riders. New Ventra Cards on iPhone will build on the strength of the existing Ventra system to make commuting in Chicago even easier and more convenient, and help modernize America’s second largest mass transit system for the 21st century. When one of the world’s most inventive cities teams up with one of the world’s most innovative  companies, great things happen.”

Statement from Rachel Notley, Leader of Alberta’s Official NDP Opposition:  “Today's replacement of the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly is an unprecedented and shocking development that raises serious concerns about the level of non-partisan service that can be expected by members of the Official Opposition from the Speakers Office and the associated Legislative Assembly Office (LAO).  Merwan Saher’s only crime can be described as being a nationally respected public official with a multi-decade long record of objective, neutral and exceptional public service.  Merwan Saher, who was fired Friday, previously served for eight years as the Auditor General for the province of Alberta and has worked nearly four decades in public office. In his role as Auditor General he held all public bodies — and members — to account, regardless of their political stripes.  This decision was taken without any consultation with the Official Opposition or without any formal or professional hiring process. Moreover, it will undoubtedly incur a very large financial cost to taxpayers to compensate Mr. Saher. We call on the Speaker to disclose this cost to Albertans.  This move, combined with the plan to ram through changes to the standing orders that remove the rights of Private Members to propose and pass bills, along with the new prohibition on allowing private members to introduce constituents and members of the public in the House is all part of a coordinated effort by the UCP to muzzle those that don’t agree with the new Premier and to suppress the democratic traditions of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta.”

The Freedom Dividend Matters  A Personal Story  All personal names have been changed. My boyfriend's name is Danny. His mom, Melinda, lives in Ocala, FL.  Melinda was recently diagnosed with lung cancer and is currently recovering from surgery. She runs a small business that barely nets her enough to get by. And she's going to lose about six weeks of work while getting hit with huge medical expenses. She has an old Obama Care policy with astronomical out-of-pocket costs.  We experienced everything Yang said. All our discussions were about money. We looked for help, but most programs require you to be out of work for 12 months. This is a massive hole for those without savings. But her friends are amazing, they collected money, but it’s a poor community and there's only so much people can spare.  Then, one day back home from surgery, her dog Nano injured his leg. She's divorced and lives alone with Nano. And now her only emotional support is crying and limping around the house. Nano needs a $4,000 surgery. And | realized... Medicare for All won't cover animals.  | think about the #FreedomDividend and how it would transform this community. It wouldn't just be money to help Melinda with her bills now. It's money in her community. Her business does better. Her friends can lend more. The entire community is strengthened. And it can be applied where it’s needed.  Just so you don't worry. We found an Angel donor. An animal lover with the means to cut a very large check for Nano and other expenses. There's still the emotional stress of surgery. But we could always afford emotional support. The real solution to our problems was just money. | dread, what happened to all the families that didn’t find an Angel...  | put a lot of time into this campaign because Yang convinced me. It makes perfect sense. | can’t contribute much in cash so | donate time designing little cards about Yang's policies even though I'm not a designer at all. And once | even handed out some cards at Pride.  But this June, the reason | put so much time into this campaign became personal. Because the family of someone | love deserves better than what America is currently offering. That's why I'm #YangGang  And Nano is heckin cute dammit!  If you read this entire story, | thank you from the bottom of my heart. Q Medlow, Danny, Melinda and Nano

JUSTIN TRUDEAU, PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA        Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Pipeline Announcement     Finally, | am also pleased to announce that we will keep our commitment to implement a moratorium on crude oil tanker shipping on British Columbia’s north coast.  After consulting at length with people who live and work there - including Indigenous partners — we've heard firsthand how detrimental crude oil tanker traffic is to this region.  Very shortly, we'll introduce legislation to make this tanker moratorium the law.  As a grandson of BC, | strongly believe that this moratorium - coupled with the rejection of the Northern Gateway Pipeline — is the right call for the people of this province, and for Canada.

The ball would come over and he would catch it back, knock it up and volley it back where it came from. Everything was so classy, I couldn't wait to watch him play. Then when I met to man, it was “Oh my God, what a cunt. I can't believe this.”

CUBA (Tier 3)  Cuba is principally a'§ the country. Some Cuban medical Rome have stated that postings abroad are voluntary and well paid; however, others have claimed that their services “repaid” Cuban government debts to other countries and their passports were withheld as they performed their services. The scope of trafficking within Cuba is difficult to gauge due to the closed nature of the government and sparse non- governmental or independent reporting        address the issue. However, the government did not prohibit all forms of trafficking during the reporting ait nor did it provide specific evidence that it prosecuted and punished trafficking offenders, protected victims of all forms of trafficking, or implemented victim protection policies or programs to prevent human trafficking  Recommendations for Cuba: Enact legislation criminalizing all forms of human trafficking; establish legal provisions to ensure sex and labor trafficking victims are not punished for unlawful acts, such as prostitution violations, committed as a direct result of being trafficked; in partnership with trafficking victim specialists, ensure adults and children have access to adequate victim protection and assistance; and allow Cubans who work outside of Cuba to maintain possession of their passports.

The two held a meeting on Syria at the Presidential Complex in Ankara earlier on Tuesday.  Erdogan said at the Justice and Development (AK Party) Party's parliamentary group meeting ‘on Tuesday morning that Bolton's comments on the YPG were unacceptable, and that Turkey could not accept the US' stated condition.  Bolton stated on Sunday that the US military withdrawal from Northeastern Syria is conditioned on defeating the remnants of Daesh terrorist group, and on Turkey assuring the safety of fighters allied with the United States — the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which is dominated by the YPG terrorists.  Bolton and Kalin had a productive discussion regarding the United States' decision to withdraw from Syria, Spokesperson for the US National Security Council Garrett Marquis said after the meeting on Tuesday morning.  Marquis added in a statement that the two sides had identified further issues for dialogue and that the US looks forward to ongoing military-to-military consultations.  US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford and James Jeffrey, the US Special Representative for Syria and the Special Envoy for the Anti-Daesh Coalition, also attended the meeting that lasted a little over two hours.     https  /en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx? 3971018000881

Involving money as payment/ reward is something else.  I'm not even sure if there is a BBM/A ruling for this. This isnt even legal in general.

IPO Or Not, Tesla Won't Survive As Independent, Analysts Say  JOHN VOELCKER  & JUNE 30, 2010  ®, COMMENT NOW!  Q uick, name the last automaker to go public before yesterday's Tesla Motors IPO. Stumped?  It was Ford Motor Company. The year was 1956.  Perhaps buyers of Tesla Motors stock [NSDQ:TSLA] were optimistic because they had little context to assess the comapny. Tesla's stock soared from its offering price of $17 to close at $23.89 by the end of yesterday, meaning  Tesla Motors is now worth $2.2 billion.  Not bad for a company that's sold just over 1,000 cars and  lost almost $300 million in its seven-year life.

““ TA  ah TS  Tatts
tmz.com @e :  "Empire" star Jussie Smollett was brutally attacked by 2 men who beat him up, put his head in a noose and screamed, "This is MAGA country.”  Sources directly connected to Jussie tell TMZ, the actor arrived in Chicago from New York late Monday, and at around 2 AM he was hungry and went to a Subway. We're told when shortly after he walked out on his way home, someone yelled, "Aren't you that f***ot 'Empire’ n*****?"  The 2 men -- both white and wearing ski masks -- viciously attacked Jussie as he fought back, but they beat him badly and fractured a rib. They put a rope around his neck, poured bleach on him and as they left they yelled, "This is MAGA country.”

DON’T BE LIKE MOST PEOPLE.  Most say it...Few do it.  Most stay surface...Few dive deep.  Most have opinions...Few understand.  Most expect a gain...Few embrace the pain.  Most can do it once...Few are willing to sustain it.  Most focus on the reward...Few focus on the requirement.  Most genuinely want it...Few work hard and smart to go get it. Most wish it was easier...Few choose to do what is better & harder.  EMBRACE THE CHASE. DO THE WORK.

Navy cyber warfare chief is Obama's pick to lead NSA  By BY KEN DILANIAN J 2     WASHINGTON — Navy cryptologist Michael 3, Rogers is President Obama's top choice to take over the embattled National Security Agency — which conducts electronie surveillance operations worldwide — and the Pentagon's cyber warfare command, officials say.  Rogers’ experience includes 3o years in the Navy, where he rose to vice admiral and managed the intelligence portfolio for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Currently, he runs the Navy's eyber warfare arm.     If confirmed by the Senate, Rogers, 54, will succeed Gen. Keith Alexander, who is retiring after leading the NSA through one of the toughest periods in its history — the hemorrhaging of secrets by former contractor Edward Snowden. That will put Rogers in the public eye for the foreseeable future.

#FreeBritney  THE #FREEBRITNEY MOVEMENT HAS COME UNDER FIRE This is in response to Britney Spears’ new instagram video and post amongst other statements made in reference to the movement by the media  #FREEBRITNEY REPRESENTATIVE, NELSON SAAVEDRA JR., SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE #FREEBRITNEY MOVEMENT:  #FreeBritney does NOT condone the death threats/harassment that the Spears family and co. have endured in the past week. Those who are partaking in those actions are a vocal minority and do not represent the #FreeBritney movement at large.  #FreeBritney is advocating for Britney Spears’ release and freedom from the 11+ year long CONSERVATORSHIP over her person and estate. The Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health describes an LPS CONSERVATORSHIP as follows: “According to the Welfare and Institutions Code [of California], a conservator may be appointed for a person who is gravely disabled meaning that, as a result of a mental disorder, the person is unable to provide for food, clothing or shelter.”  We believe that Spears, having recorded/promoted 4 studio albums, performed on 4 world tours (and a Las Vegas Residency), and been a judge on The X-FACTOR during the 11+ year duration of the conservatorship no longer meets the criteria for an LPS CONSERVATORSHIP by showing she can clearly “provide for food, clothing, and shelter.”  Spears has attempted to dissolve the conservatorship several times in its 11+ year span. Multiple psychiatrists have evaluated Spears and determined the LPS CONSERVATORSHIP to be unnecessary. We believe that Britney Spears no longer wants to or deserves to be under a CONSERVATORSHIP.  A STATEMENT DIRECTLY TO BRITNEY SPEARS  Britney, we want you to have full privacy. Your personal and medical history is NONE of our business. That being said, the conservatorship is PUBLIC RECORD and is our business when we, as fellow citizens, believe that your human rights are being violated and possibly abused,  Until this conservatorship is dissolved, it will be increasingly difficult, as fans, to support anything you do professionally as we can not verify whether YOU or YOUR CONSERVATOR are making those professional decisions on your behalf. We are aware of how many people benefit from your work and will be weary of supporting that work until we know wholeheartedly that every decision is YOURS.  We have so much love for you. You have unknowingly been there for us throughout our lives, through some of our most pivotal moments. It's time we repay the favor #FreeBritney.  Yours Truly, Your fans (The #FreeBritney Movement)  Ifyou have any further questions please contact freebritney2019@gmail.com

Why Survivors of Sexual Violence Choose Cannabis to Heal  “Sexual abuse and other types of intense trauma can change the body's communication pathway between the brain and the adrenal glands,” Dr. Sulak says. “This usually results in overactive adrenal function, producing excessive levels of the stress hormone cortisol.” Dr. Sulak relayed that cannabis often works by suppressing excessive activity in the body. “If the fight-or-flight branch of the nervous system is too activated, cannabis can help bring this back to normal. If the neural pathways related to trauma are being overused, cannabis can turn them down or turn them off.”


‘Art by Joe Orsak  CASEY ON THE JUICE  by HART SEELY  “The outlook wasr'tbrilliant for the Mudville nine that year “The lineup had no hitting threats, the fans no cause to cheer.  ‘So when Cooney tore his hamstring, and then Barrows broke his wrist, “The writers started calling for the brass to be dismissed,  "The season stood in jeopardy, with one last hope in sight: Ifonly one great slugger could regain his former might. ‘One shot of horse testosterone, one jab in his caboose, ‘The team could get its mojo back with Casey on the juice!  But Flynn had tested positive, and also jimmy Blake, “Their samples glowed with hormones lke uranium yelloweake, “The infield faced suspension, the outfield in decay,  The team was dead unless some source came forth with antler spray.        But Flynn unleashed ten lawyers, to the wonderment of ll, And Blake, with much persuasion, had his cousin take the fll And with the last indictment quashed, a miracle occurred,  “The Mudville nine remained within one game of placing third.  Within the team top management, there rose a whispered din: “We need to find a slugger who can drive some runners in.  A deep-voiced man with swollen breasts, his beard as thiek as rope. ‘We need to bring back Casey, with his bloodstream full of dope!”  Hed all but been forgotten, in the pennant race of late, No team considered signing him; hed last hit 208,  He couldn't touch the breaking ball or move much to his right. ‘Held shrunken by some 30 pounds; he looked like Betty White.     ‘They found him in a halfway house for former alcoholics, ‘Where he'd been kicking Andriol and street-sale anabolic. “They offered him a contract that would run from day to day, But his sample had to come back clean before they/d let him play.  “There was ease in Casey's manner, though he tried to be discreet. “The testers watched him carefully; they figured he would cheat. “The sample showed diuretics, high above the zone of red.  “That ain't my urine’ said Casey. “Strike one!” the clinic said.  ‘The pundits, amped on Ritalin, fumed fury at the game. Hell never see another pitch or make the Hall of Fame! “Ban him! Ban the juicer!” came a fervent, shouted wail, And its likely they@a-done it, had not Casey looked so frail     With a smile of Christian charity old Casey's visage shone.  He chalked itoff to linseed oil, not high testosterone.  Hel suffered from a restless leg, took pill to beat the flu,  But the next test showed growth hormone, and the lab coats roared, “Strike twot”  “Fraud!” cried the gin-fueled writers, and the bloggers echoed, “Fraud” But Casey's hired publicist pronounced the tests as flawed.  And now his face grew stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain. ‘They knew hed never let himself score positive again.     “The smile is gone from Casey's lips, his eyes like burst balloons; He’ downed ten quarts of seltzer after eating fifty pranes.  His body isa furnace, his bladder surely stressed,  And now the world awaits the hard results of Casey's test.  0, somewhere in this favored land the stars are shining bright ‘The games are played by people of a normal weight and height. And somewhere fans are laughing, at peace with what they've gots But there is no joy in Mudville—mighty Casey's tested hot.  ~ w

In the live broadcast of the Eurovision Song Contest Grand Final, two of Madonna's dancers briefly displayed the Israeli and Palestinian flags on the back of their outfits. This element of the performance was not part of the rehearsals which had been cleared with the EBU and the Host Broadcaster, KAN. The Eurovision Song Contest is a non- political event and Madonna had been made aware of this.
